15,springboard,Data Science Career Track,5.0,"This course is a nice fit between 'learn on your own' and 'get a Masters' for people looking to work as data scientists. I tried learning Python on my own but it was only getting me so far, and I didn't want to do a full Masters because of time and money.... Read More This specific course gives an excellent Primer to all of the major data science subdomains. Python, Statistics, NLP, Classification, Time Series, Network Analysis, Spark, and more. Data Science is a Deep Field, this course gives you the skills needed to navigate that Random Forest, including a wise guide in the form of a mentor. The mentor to me was the most invaluable part of this, I could solve a problem in a 5min conversion what might have taken 3hours, if ever, by Googling. By the end, I was able to 'Read the Docs' and apply methods that were not even covered in the official curriculum (Survival Analysis, PyTorch, PyHive), something I was NOT able to do prior to this course. It is, as the name suggests, a springboard, which worked well in my case.Read Less"
16,springboard,Data Science Career Track,5.0,"I was a student of Springboard's Data Science Career Track between July and November 2017. Completing the track has been one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life. The track was extremely streamlined and sufficiently challenging to keep you involved... Read More for the entire duration.The biggest take away of the program was the mentorship. My mentor, Baran, taught me skills that you will never find in a book or a publicly offered MOOC. He also gave me invaluable glimpses into the world of professional data science. With his constant guidance, I was able to participate in Data Science Hackathons, publish and gather traction for my kernels on Kaggle and develop a proposal for a talk on Inferential Statistics which was accepted in SciPy India 2017.Another huge benefit of the program is the network you get to build. Springboard mentors and alumni work at amazing places. I connected and interacted with more than a dozen people doing inspiring work. My mentor personally introduced me to Data Scientists at Airbnb (my first capstone project was on Airbnb User Bookings) and Amazon. They, in turn, gave me a sneak peak of their work at their respective companies.As part of DSC, I completed over 15 technical projects and 2 major Capstone Projects. With the help of my mentor, I was able to channel my work in the right places. My analysis on TED Talks caught the eye of the Kaggle CEO who then submitted my notebook to the official TED Team. My second capstone project on Movie Recommender Systems had me publishing a dataset that was trending at the top for 3 straight days. The material I learnt from Springboard also helped me in performing reasonably well in Data Science Competitions. My bachelors' thesis project on Fake News Detection is also based on the knowledge I acquired from the program. Finally, DSC prepares you for the non technical aspects of getting a job. There are intensive, personal evaluations of your LinkedIn Profile, your resume and mock interviews. These exercises prepare you well for evaluating, applying and eventually interviewing for various data science jobs.All in all, DSC is a great investment if you want to switch careers or get started with the field of Data Science. It prepares you for entry level Data Science jobs and equips you with enough expertise to jump into more advanced material after the program. Highly recommended!Read Less"

There are a ton of online resources for free but it's pretty much impossible to know where to start without guidance.The course does a great job of starting you from basics but they move you on pretty quick from there in case you already have a foundation in CS or statistics. They match you with a mentor who can give feedback on your projects or answer any questions you might have about the material or the industry.

After some crushing learning time by my own, I was more comfortable in the next couple of classes. The pratices are beyond the course mateirals, which will encourage the students to learn by themselves during their spare time. It could be hard in the beginning, but if you are motivated, and keep learning, it should be ok in the end.

My favorite part about Springboard is the connection with my mentor. My mentor helped me tremendously with my capstone projects and gave me great advice in the workplace. The one thing that I had hoped for from Springboard is referrals. It is very difficult to build connections in a short period of time and then ask for referrals when applying for jobs. Hearing back from companies after applying and reaching out via Linkedin has been a struggle for me. It would be nice to receive a little more help in the job search. I am still looking for a job.

33,springboard,Data Science Career Track,3.7,"I started the Data Science Career Track bootcamp in April 2018, completed Aug 2018. BACKGROUND: Graduated with a master's in one of the biosciences, few months prior to bootcamp. Due to my work, already had background in data analysis, stats, and programming... Read More in another language besides Python. Some Python tutorials were sufficient for applying to this bootcamp. CURRICULUM: Covers required basics, esp for data science interviews. Mostly based on pre-existing materials online, but Springboard does the legwork of sifting through the overwhelming sea of Internet resources and curating them into a chronological curriculum. Additionally, they’ve got their own resources, including lists of interview questions and networking how-to’s. These were immensely helpful. I also used the interview questions as a study guide, which paid off as several topics appeared in actual interviews. STAFF/MENTOR: Lots of support – you can schedule calls with a career coach, do mock interviews, and generally interact with other people in what could otherwise be an isolated journey of self-teaching. Incredibly professional and knowledgeable staff, very responsive customer support. I was also very happy with my mentor. The first one I was assigned to was a bit lackluster, but after having to postpone my start date, I ended up with another one. My weekly call with him helped me stay on track, and he was incredibly helpful and encouraging. This included post-bootcamp, when I sought his advice on choosing between jobs.CAPSTONE PROJECTS: Critical part of my resume, since I didn’t have industry experience or data sci projects where I used machine learning. Starting a project can be intimidating and unfamiliar, so the bootcamp provided me structure. Another Springboard staff member grades your project and provides feedback - I wish their comments/suggestions were more detailed though. COST: Steeper than I’d liked, but it paid off. I had the freedom to pursue this full-time, so I did the per-monthly plan hoping I’d complete it within 2-3 months. I ended up taking 4 months, but still avoided the heftier 6-month charge.JOB HUNT: Again, YMMV – like I suspect w/ many bootcamps out there. It’ll be up to you to do a lot of the networking. I reviewed my Springboard curriculum, plus lots of extra reading outside the curriculum (particularly practice tech &amp; behavioral questions). Also deployed one of my Springboard projects as a Flask web app. I went to events/Meetups, did informational phone calls w/ close and distant contacts, and applied to several jobs (requiring cover letters) each week. Overall: Good self-paced curriculum that covers the basics. Pricey, YMMV, but worth it for me ultimately. I found a job 2 months after completing the bootcamp, but a lot of the post-bootcamp work was on me to apply, network, etc. Happy with my mentor and interactions with staff.Read Less"
34,springboard,Data Science Career Track,4.7,"I started looking for an online training/certification on Data Science in Jan 2017 and found Springboard as one of the best in terms of their curriculum.

Read More - As an educational resource for topics including excel, sql, python, ML, sklearn and designing analyses, the bootcamp was excellent. I think the instructors went above and beyond. They were highly qualified and professional. They were also very likeable people that made the 10 weeks enjoyable. But that's the full extent of what the bootcamp offers. After a showcase in week 10 which was poorly attended by actual hiring partners, there was no further career support (that I would consider valuable). In the end, the bootcamp provided a small handful of generic events including a linkedin/resume building seminar.

(2) It's mentor supported, very few if any online program offer that (3) It has a job guarantee. Overall, the experience was fantastic.The curriculum, while not perfect, is well curated and organized and covers not just technical subjects, but also career support. I get 30 minutes with a mentor every week to review my assignments, answer my questions, etc. My mentor had similar background as I do and had gone through the academia to industry transition before, so he was able to offer valuable advices in addition to technical guidance. At the end of the course, I was required to pass 4 mock interviews and complete two capstone projects which prepared me a lot for the job hunting. I landed interviews from many companies, from start-up to large companies like Amazon, near the end of my study. Though, I have to say, the course alone won't be enough for interviews at the likes of Amazon and Google, it should be sufficient to help you land you positions at mid-tier companies.Overall, I find what I learned very useful, the experience with my mentor pleasant, and the cost reasonable. If you are someone who is considering transition to data science, but cannot quit your job for dedicated bootcamps, I definitely recommend this program from Springboard.Read Less"
44,springboard,Data Science Career Track,4.0,"I know the curriculum has changed since I started the course Oct 2017, so some of the criticisms may no longer apply. The strongest part of the course is the access to the mentor(s) and the team of career coaches. The curated course content overall is... Read More very good, though some lectures are from 4-5 years ago.The main focus is the two capstones and the mentor interaction to keep you moving forward on them.The Python datacamp courses (at the time) where mostly useful, though at some points I used other materials from courses like Udemy or LinkedIn Learning where the curriculum fell short of the coursework being asked.The coursework at many points has incorrect time-estimates for the (2-4 hrs suggested but actually needing 10-20). Some coursework questions and worksheets were out of date or missing. If you have a full-time job then staying on a schedule based on the course completion time then you will be as frustrated with this as we were. The most common observation on the forums was the poorly supported statistics element, with insufficient course material for a crucial element of data science and insufficient study material for the coursework.I have worked every week/other week with my career coach to refine my resume, profile etc. I am getting invitations to on-site interviews and phone screens.Read Less"

As for the mentor, I think it is also a great sell from the program. It is great to have a 1:1 personal mentor. I learned a lot of industrial experience and how to become a data scientist what companies are looking for.

Read More administrative team- Excellent career support team with advice well in line with reality, always super friendly- Show you how to network properly- Annual springboard rise event- Involved student communityCons: - too much use of videos and not enough use of reading for many of the subjects. Many of the topics could have been better explained from a book or article than watching many of the webinars from Harvard or pycon in my opinion. Those videos were often very lengthy and hard to follow along with and I found myself skimming through them. They didnt have decent background information before the these videos that would delve into complex subjects sometimes. This is my biggest complaint to be honest. - Some of the assignments needed better instructions such as the databricks miniproject. I know trying to figure something out yourself is the best way to learn but when you dont have the preknowledge on something so new to you it could be frustratingSummary:Springboard was exactly what I needed as someone coming from a background in business and who had next to zero technical skills such as coding. I landed a role as a contingent worker at Facebook as a business data analyst. Without a masters degree or more extensive work experience in tech working with data, i still havent been well suited for a data scientist position, so I'm supplementing this with starting a masters degree program in data scientist, but I believe if you already have a masters in any field and or have remotely relevant experience working with data, a masters degree wont be needed to land a data scientist position like I think is needed for me.

While there are many smaller mini projects included in the course that are also good practice to improving python and sql skills, there could be created content designed for learning the code and applications needed in these types of assignments. A significant portion of the curriculum was just courses on DataCamp and video lectures, while informative, are not particularly useful in grasping the concepts needed. For an expensive course, I was expecting more specialized resources focused on learning the skills needed, rather than just projects that force you to know the material and go out and use it, which is difficult at first and slowed my progress throughout the beginning of the course.

One thing that may require improvement is the course material, which appears to be a big collection of online videos and articles.

127,springboard,Data Science Career Track,4.0,"A little background: I'm currently about 25% through Springboard's Data Science Career Track program. My professional background is in higher education. I recently completed a PhD in philosophy and have experience teaching undergraduate philosophy courses.... Read More I have minimal background in math beyond the high school level, but my philosophy degrees have prepared me for the sort of technical and critical thinking skills used in data science. I'm doing the Springboard program to make a career change. I completed most of Springboard's Data Science Prep Course, which I found helpful, before being accepted into the Career Track program.Review: Overall, my experience in the Career Track program has been pretty good so far. My impression is that the quality of one's experience with the program depends largely on the quality of one's mentor. My mentor was initially pretty poor, and I had a difficult time understanding his accent. But I reached out to Springboard early in the program, and they helped reassign me to a new mentor. Thankfully, my new mentor is excellent and has dramatically improved my experience. I'm in a study group with other students, and I've gotten the impression that their mentors are so-so. I have learned a lot so far in the program, and I've been especially happy with Springboard's ""customer support"" (very friendly and helpful) and career support (they get you started on job stuff early on in the program). A fair portion of the data science curriculum (so far) has consisted of Datacamp exercises. Springboard partners with Datacamp, and students get free access to Datacamp courses. Honestly, I haven't been that impressed with the Datacamp courses. They are helpful for gaining superficial exposure to tools and skills used in data science, but they don't cultivate a deep understanding. I will say that the time estimates Springboard gives (completion in 6 months, working 15-20 hrs a week) are pretty unrealistic. Most of my study group (including me) is working on the course full time, and we are all on track to finish in 5 months (at the earliest), and probably more like 6 months. Unless you already have significant data science experience, don't expect to finish the program in under 5 months, and possibly even under 6 months.Overall, given my experience so far, I would probably recommend (pretty highly) Springboard's program to people (depending on their circumstances). I'm happy to discuss my experience with people if anyone would like to know more, especially people with an academic background in the humanities.

Read More from the prep course, how to use their platform called Synapse, all of this is done through Slack which is simple enough to use.Once you have all the prework done, it sets you up for what to expect in this class, how to use SQL and the software Tableau. Our instructors Rohan and Micheal were super transparent with us as a group - We weren't leaving this class with full understanding of SQL, and the various implementations of it.. but a solid foundation and what we need to know to get around SQL commands in the simplest form. This is exactly what I needed. It was a refreshing and fun way to get the basics, with the expectation to do extensive practice at home so we can sharpen our skills.Speaking of Micheal and Rohan, they were a pleasure to learn from. They both have a different background, one more analytical and one more on the data science side, and it was a perfect combination. It was a light environment and the classes seemed to fly by quickly. We had almost 20 students, but they both managed to give us all personal attention when needed - which was a plus.I entered this course to better understand how data works, how to understand data and pull key insights and i left with exactly that.Yes, the course is expensive, but if you actually implement what they're teaching you can learn quite a bit.Read Less"

Read More world of data analytics. Aside from the theoretical concepts of data analytics, I was able to gain hands-on experience using tools such as advanced Excel, SQL, and Tableau. Very quickly, I applied the skills I learned in class to real-life challenges at my job. I took the “Online Live” version of the course, so there was a bit of adjustment in the beginning. A few things you might want to consider when choosing online live over in-class:Pros: — You can attend class from anywhere. Although the instructor is based in Vancouver, we had individuals who checked in from other cities and time zones. — The format of the online live version is just like the in-class version. No worries about feeling like you’re missing out on the BrainStation experience. — Things were easier to see because it was happening right on your computer screen instead of squinting at a monitor at the front of a classroom. Cons:— You miss out on some of the spontaneity and organic conversation that occurs in a real-life classroom. People in the class seemed to be apprehensive about chiming in because it’s a video conference.— Since data analytics is a very hands-on type of class as opposed to something like digital marketing which involves a lot more explanation of concepts, you miss out on some of the benefits of having an instructor physically present. For example, many students ran into some tech issues when using SQL or Tableau, but they couldn’t easily show their screen to the instructor. Overall, the instructor dealt with these issues to the best of his abilities. Despite these small hiccups, I definitely recommend this BrainStation course and Online Live!Read Less"

The pace rapidly increases however and the course covers many core data science concepts over the weeks that follow. This was one of the things I liked most about the course – as it covers a broad range of subjects you get a solid overall understanding of the foundations behind data science, which sets you up nicely for further study and research in the future.Parin Shah was our instructor for this course – he was very good. Very patient teaching style and happy to slow down and go over things as many times as necessary for them to sink in. Would recommend.As for the platform (doing the course online live rather than in person) this was good and offered more interaction with my peers on the course than I expected. I would recommend a 2 screen set-up for this course if you have the hardware available – it is a great to be able to go through the material with the instructor on one screen while trying things out as you go along on the other screen as well.Overall this was a great experience – I know a lot more about data science and python than I did a few months ago!

While I was working through it, this specific course got updated and I really like the new version. I see that they are putting work on it, but I also think that some other aspects need to get updated sooner than later.- No course regarding big data or cloud computing. The 2nd project we have to use Deep Learning components where we might have to handle 100K+ rows of data. For a normal computer, training a model can take a couple of hours (in my case 37 hours).

The springboard support team is really helpful and they go out of their way to make you life easy during the course. Things you should watch out for: The estimated time suggested by Springboard for each topic is kind of on the lower range so you need to keep that in mind to plan your studies. Also, a very important thing to consider is that this is a mentor based course where in you get a mentor assigned to you for the entire course time who guides you through your projects.

This turned out to be essential for me, because he not only corrected my code, but he corrected my way of thinking, which improved my work exponentially. He also introduced me to other resources that would dramatically improve my coding abilities, and every week he pushed me to think a little harder and do a little better. It's worth noting that the curriculum is curated, and so you could theoretically complete the equivalent program by paying a small subscription fee on Next.tech's site. But what Springwood really gets right is the structure of the program and the quality of their mentors and community. Best of all, the prep program is free if you end up going into the full data science career track program (they reimburse you 10 days in).

This is a double edged sword because you learned how to do something, applied it for the next segment but would go a weeks without having practiced it. I spent a lot of time referring back which was frustrating. The most frustrating aspect is for most of the mini-projects, the assignments would ask you to do either new concepts/code or use functions/methods/attributes that were not emphasized in the interactive lessons. I again spent a lot of time referring back, combing through my notes, only to discover, it was not covered or not sufficiently. Perhaps, this would not be an issue if you had some previous skill with Python or a lower level language. My previous language was R.The one thing that can make or break your experience is your assigned mentor. (And by the way, I would have never persisted through the frustration without a mentor.) I spent the first 5-6 weeks with a mentor who was not a good fit. This set me back for the first half of the course. I ended up changing my data set for the first capstone project after I had been working on it for three months. Luckily, my second mentor was extremely helpful and an expert. When I changed data sets, things started to come together. I also started to use more of the resources that Springboard provides - the on-call mentor and the TAs. I could not get much out of the community chat because even within my cohort there was a different pace.The career track means data science as a career. The career mentors were focused on getting jobs for data scientist or data analyst titles. I found out a few months into the track that I didn't really want to be an entry level data scientist.

191,springboard,Data Science Career Track,4.3,"Positives:+	MentorshipBy far the biggest strength of Springboard, so big that others have copied it. My mentor was just the person I had craved for a long time in my educational career: smart, good people skills, and accountable. I learned as much from... Read More him as I did in my Master’s program. The 30 minutes a week were invaluable and gave me insights I would not have found on my own.+	CurriculumFor the most part, the curriculum is very good. It’s a combination of online resources Springboard doesn’t create themselves, but if I had to learn data science all over again, I would rather learn from these resources than random Google searches. Save the Google searches for the projects, where most of the learning comes from anyway. The curriculum is also more up-to-date than an in-person program. The projects stretched me to my limits, and I came out a much better data scientist because of it. +	Course SupportThere has been an increase in course support over my time at Springboard. There is an option to have an additional mentorship meeting with a different mentor just to work on non-Capstone projects. Springboard also hosts an annual conference at their headquarters that is worth attending if you are a student. My student adviser provided great support along the way when I needed it.Negatives:-	Job SupportSpringboard is by no means a silver bullet to a dream data science job, but it’s close. You have to put in the work to landing a job to get that job afterwards. I found there were times where the career coaches were booked months in advance, but they seemed to have hired new staff. I have no doubt if you complete the course in six months that you would be ready for a DS role, but it’s an intense six months.- Completion TimeI took much longer than expected and was given extensions to finish. This was more a human error than a Springboard error, and if I felt mentally the way I do now compared to when I started Springboard, I could have easily finished in the allotted time. Just be careful with grandiose capstone projects.- FeedbackOutside of my mentor, I found feedback tough to get when handing in coursework. Overall: Great experience, would do again. The positives are fixable and far outweigh the negatives and I found it paid for itself in salary raises, even with the extensions. This is the direction education is going, and I look forward to watching what Springboard does next.Read Less"

199,brainstation,Data Analytics,4.3,"The Data Analytics online course was my second BrainStation course, with the first being on campus in Vancouver. I was impressed with the sheer volume of information covered in the 10-week certificate program. Our instructor, Mike Lake, was not only knowledgeable... Read More in the topics and tools covered, but he was transparent with the classroom when he didn’t know the answer to a query, with the promise to share the solution with us in a future session. As a former homeschooled student, the online learning format is very practical for the way I tend to learn. I know online learning can be daunting for many, but the entire BrainStation team made me feel supported and encouraged throughout the course.My background in technology happened very much by chance, so I’m always eager to upgrade my current skill set to reflect the most in-demand skills in today’s evolving workforce. Data analytics has been on my radar for quite some time and having gone through the course, I can say that I have a broader understanding of its value and the scope of day-to-day decisions that both good and bad data can impact.One drawback is that, due to the volume of information covered in each classroom session, there isn’t much time to go over exercises together “in class”, which I find significantly impacts my ability to retain new information by being able to practice is over and over again. Because of this speedy pace, I found that I wasn’t able to retain new concepts as well as I have with other learning formats. This wasn’t a reflection of the teaching, but rather the sheer volume of course content that needed to be covered.My only other feedback (with both BrainStation courses I’ve taken) is that you aren’t truly prepared to hit the ground running after just 10 weeks of training. From my experience, students need to spend at least as much time outside of class each week preparing, researching and practicing the tools and techniques taught as they spend in class, if not more. In addition, most graduates will need to hone these newly taught skills every day on their own before being able to take on a full-time role in this industry with confidence.Otherwise, I am so pleased I took this course...it opened my eyes to the valuable world of data and gave me a backstage view of how good data can change everything in a company....from customer service to marketing to supply chain.Read Less"

This decision turned out to be an amazing add on to my existing set of skills and made me a much better engineer.Experience summary:- High workload;- High complexity on the topics;- So many new and useful things learned!- Machine Learning module is awesome, but short.- Very competent teaching staff;- Super responsible and caring administrative staff;- Cool extra seminars along the bootcamp, for example: Build an ETL Pipeline, Build a Django App;- Beer and pizza offered by IronHack on events! :)Detailed experience:The program is very well distributed. The first weeks were mainly dedicated to learn basic programming and to clean data in Python. Since, data cleaning is such an important feature on a Data Scientist, the program has a very intensive approach on this subject (Very cool and useful!). We also spent a few days learning SQL, which is great, because it gives you a feel of the data warehousing task. Then, we learned how to manipulate data and make it 'readable' for everyone, using super interesting data visualization libraries and software. At this point, we were only at the first part of the bootcamp. The workload was really high and the tasks were not easy, but I was learning so much! I thought it couldn't get more difficult, but then, second part of the bootcamp came on...After this point not only the workload increased, but the complexity of the subjects studied also increased! We started going deep on Statistics. This was a very challenging and important part of the bootcamp, since Statistics are one of the stepping stones of Data Analytics. The last weeks were dedicated to the coolest topic (in my opinion) - Machine Learning! We got to learn multiple algorithms and techniques to develop prediction projects. In the last project on campus (2 weeks project), we had to develop a Machine Learning Model and present our results. I was really happy and excited on the last weeks, cause I got to see and feel the potential of an amazing technology like Machine Learning. However, I got the feeling that we needed to dedicate more time on the Machine Learning module. The program should be reviewed in the sense that it should dedicate more time to study Deep Learning. The teaching staff was very competent! We had 4 teachers available - 1 lead teacher and 3 assistant teachers. They were really good educating and there was always someone available to help. Very effective teaching system!Besides the technical characteristics and the teaching staff of the program, I also feel that is important to refer that the administrative IronHack staff was really amazing with me.

There was never a time that I felt alone, even now that we needed to transit to remote we have total support from the Ironhack family!I'm trying to figure out some cons but for me it's hard because I really came out of it feeling as a better person and with a lot of relevant tools in my arsenal that are importante for the job market.The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that I didn't have time to properly say goodbye to some of my colleagues that needed to return home without much of a notice due to the covid-19 outbreak. With this you can see that the bonds that were created during the 9 week bootcamp can only be matched by the level of knowledge that I acquired.Thank you Ironhack Lisbon, now together to the job hunt!!Read Less"

212,springboard,Data Science Career Track,4.7,"This program was a bootcamp with much information in a short amount of time. There are many avenues of support from your assigned mentor and on-call mentors, career coaches, advisors, project advisors, a community forum, and options to join study groups.... Read More I highly recommend taking the opportunity to join a study group and create a slack channel, have weekly meetings, and support each other. I had done prepwork with two other online companies; Thinkful and Galvanize. I looked into other online bootcamps by those two and also General Assembly. Further I highly considered joining the in person Galvanize bootcamp in Denver, including visiting them for a tour. Why choose Springboard? To drive and hour into a city, Denver, 5 days a week for 13 weeks was a big stressor on top of the curriculum for Galvanize. I looked into living there in the city, which is not my comfort zone and very expensive! Thinkful seemed to be extremely similar to Springboard, and General Assembly too. All had requirements of living within an hour of particular major cities. I ultimately landed on Springboard midsummer because they listed both Denver and Detroit as their major cities for required money back guarantees and opportunities. Further, it offered a Data Science Prep course that would then take the tuition paid and put it toward your tuition for the main Data Science Program. I fee I am struggling to comprehend all I learned as I end my program this week. At this moment in time, and as of a few months ago, I feel for me and my own learning experience and strengths, I would have thrived even moreso had I gone the route of physically attending the Galvanize in person. I would advocate for them to consider opening a location in a place like Ann Arbor, Michigan. Rather than only big cities. Let's see how long it takes now to land a job. Springboard is very good with support after completion. I will still have career coach meetings and accountability. It is asked to make at least 7 networking connections each week, and apply for 4 jobs/week. Certainly the entire program is a formula for success if you apply yourself!Read Less"

I find this process very helpful and exciting since it makes me act as if I was a real data scientist. A special shout-out for the technical support team, teaching assistant and community managers for being so responsive, attentive and friendly (they always put a smiling icon after their explanation/message) to learners' theoretical questions as well as their challenges in coding or keeping up with the learning process. There were some points during the process I thought I could have given up had there not been their timely support and encouragement. There are two things I think the platform can improve to help learners excel more in their work: the use of English language and adding more theories. I am not a native English speaker, sometimes I found it difficult to understand what the instructions are on the platform since their English syntaxes sound unfamiliar to me.

266,springboard,Data Science Career Track,4.7,"I would recommend Springboard to anyone looking for career transition/advancement who wants to keep an open schedule. If I had the choice again, I would absolutely choose Springboard over an in-person program. Having the whole course online meant I set... Read More my own pace of study and supplemented when I felt necessary. The course material itself is great, with a fair mix of hands-on exercises and video lectures. The curriculum is littered with mini-projects for students to practice their new skills further. The best part of the program for me was probably the mentor experience. The weekly meetings are opportunities to not just review your capstone projects, but to learn how to think like a professional. If you ever feel like you need more time to discuss something (and those half hour sessions can feel short), most mentors are available for messaging or possibly even extra sessions. One thing I really liked about the program was the heavy focus on building essential non-technical skills, like networking or storytelling. Thanks to the course material and the career coaches, by graduation, I really felt like I was ready to enter the job market.Here are some changes to the curriculum I would recommend:- Make mini-project reviews more important. While I talked to my mentor about some of them, I never saw a single review in writing. I think this would be a great opportunity to discuss theory and practice code reviews.- Course material needs to be expanded in some key areas.  -Deployment was limited to one Github mini-project and a very high-level overview video. Graduating students should probably have some familiarity with Docker or other software for productionization. - Distributed computing was covered in just two sets of exercises. I'd prefer if there were not just more material on the subject, but some more discussion of the underlying theory. - While this may have been a result of me taking the ""generalist"" track, I felt the material on deep learning was way too light. We were given only one optional exercise that worked with Keras, despite it being the easiest major DL framework to learn and the least likely to be implemented at scale. Even some more optional reading material would have been nice.  In conclusion: if you're a self-starter, someone who likes to set their own schedule and do some of their own research, then pick Springboard.Read Less"

The content is sourced from a wide range of partners like DataCamp, LinkedIn Learning and Youtube and given these sources themselves update their content on a regular basis, you always get the latest and most updated material. For a field like Data Science, updated curriculum becomes a must-have.Assignments and Mini ProjectsYou have plenty of them to continuously supplement your learning of concepts with hands-on. For someone who has a non-technical background previously, this becomes essential so as to not feel overwhelmed with lots of coding and no hand-holding initially.MentorshipYou get matched with an industry mentor who has nearly similar years of experience in the industry. Not only does this foster a match in terms of mindset but also ensures a very open conversation flow between the two. Additionally, your mentor will direct you to a lot of additional online materials to supplement your learningEg:- My mentor has 6+ years of experience (same as mine)Office HoursWhile the weekly office hours are on a wide range of topic and not necessarily related to your progress on the course (not sure if that is even possible given a rolling cohort model of admission), they are a great insight into how Data Science is applied in the industry and the speakers give a lot of leads in terms of additional materials related to the topic of discussion. A brief note down of such leads act as great supplementary material when you are actually learning the topicGeneral Tips to benefit from any online MOOC/BootcampData Science, as a pathway, requires continuous learning beyond standard classroom methodology and the more materials you refer to while building your foundational concepts, the better your understanding will be.Springboard’s course gives you that direction and streamlines your learning path along with a mentor who will help you navigate in this journey.PS:- This is not a paid/biased review since I chose Springboard after going through several online bootcamp offerings (GreyAtom, Lambda School, RMOTR etc. For any further details on this, plese feel free to DM me. While I might not be a data science expert yet, however I am happy to guide you in terms of how to leverage this career track and stay motivated all the way through.And regarding the worthyness of the course, having invested my heard-earned money into this, it’s highly recommended with the caveat that be prepred to grill yourself and as long as you keep up your motivation high, you will definitely see the benefit of this learning journey as you proceed along.Read Less"

After that, we moved on to MySQL and I found that part of the course the most interesting and exciting. For the next 4 classes, we were learning basic as well as advanced commands in MySQL Workbench and participating in the class exercises. The last three classes were with Tableau, where I wish we had more assignments and tasks to do. Somewhere in the middle, we were broken into teams to prepare for our Final projects. And that was the most important part of the class. While you get all the necessary knowledge with Brainstation to get started, a major part of learning comes from the work that you do outside of the class. I cannot even describe the amount of reading I had to do to solve one problem that was standing on our way. By putting extra time into learning I ended up feeling very confident in my knowledge and skills. Now I understand that you don't always get to choose your teammates, but I got very lucky. My team was great, and we were working in sync until the end of the course. Communication was the key and I could clearly see the teams that had such a problem in their final presentations. By working together you can really create an amazing experience and enjoy the process. Our instructor was Ramin Amin, who over the length of the course was very direct in his approach, and could explain the material very well. I have to admit that the level of support that he provided outside of the class was just great. Anytime I had a problem or a question, he would get back to me within a few hours with advice or a solution. Overall I really enjoyed the course, it really helped me to step up and expand my knowledge. BrainStation really proved to be valuable in my career.Read Less"
309,brainstation,Data Analytics Certificate Course,3.7,"I recently completed the BrainStation 5-weeks Data Analytics course online! Completely through Zoom! This course is a foundational overview of Data Analytics, where you learn to use tools such as Excel, MySql and Tableau. It doesn't go completely in-depth,... Read More so you're not quite an expert yet but it's a great start. Nevertheless, truly grateful for this experience as I'm looking forward to applying these skills to my background in post-secondary admissions and marketing. The 5-weeks went by very quickly; and it was very manageable with work as the classes are in the evening. There is definitely a lot to learn and a lot to go through in a short amount of time, so do expect the need to do additional research and practice on the side to help grasp concepts. Completing the homework is also helpful; and self-learning is a necessary part of the course. Instructor Ramin was knowledgeable, friendly and able to use real-life examples as a Data Analyst himself - I always find having experienced instructors is important! Tuition is a tad pricey for a short basic course, but you can contact their Advisors and ask about scholarships and financial aid. Overall, I would recommend this course to those who are in data-driven roles and want to gain new and relevant software skills, in marketing and sales roles, wanting to become data analyst or even just curious about data!Read Less"

My only point for the prospect students is the following: data science, ML and DL are difficult things to master.

Read More coding experience, the Prep Course was definitely a great way to get my hands dirty in some of the technical aspects of coding and what the role of a data scientist may be. There are small projects sprinkled throughout to help build your understanding and comfort with the content. Some of the resources are a bit irrelevant in their applicability to real world problem solving, and are not easily translated to a professional setting. However, this is fine overall because their main goal is to get you prepped for their 6-month career track.The best part about this experience is definitely the mentorship. My mentor was incredibly helpful throughout my 4 weeks in the course. He was always engaged during our weekly meetings, and was very open to offering me advice outside of that time via fast email response. The mentorship is by far the highlight of the course, and got me excited to continue on with the Career Track.Overall, I'd recommend this course to anyone with a limited coding background considering doing a bootcamp, as it gives you those basic tools to pass the technical skills assessment and gives you the confidence to endure a 6 month bootcamp. The course is affordable and your tuition gets applied as a credit towards the already-affordable price of the full Springboard Career Tracks.Read Less"

329,springboard,Data Science Career Track,4.7,"Context: During my last year as a Ph.D. student, as I planned to pursue a career in data science, I decided to join the Data Science Career Track of the Springboard program. I was recommended by one of my Ph.D. student friends, who eventually successfully... Read More landed a good working position. I therefore decided to follow his footsteps.Overall: I am quite satisfied with Springboard's program. I think it has formed me well to become a data scientist and to quickly land a job. However, I believe there are a few things they can still improve on.Pros:- Overall Quality: the data science track definitely introduces and educates you well to the data science world, used in the industry. It covers most aspects of data science (wrangling, visualization, ML, ... ) and lets you acquire enough experience to land a job in that field. Of course, it won't replace extensive years of professional experience, but it is great way to bootstrap your data science career.- Preparedness: I would argue that the data science track doesn't require advanced programming skills, but it is best to have some Python experience (the software overwhelmingly used in the course). If you don't (like me), the first few months can be a bit of a learning curve. You eventually pass that stage though.- The Capstone Projects: the program is focused on two data science projects that you lead from start to finish. A great learning experience where you put your hands in the dirt, which you accomplish under the supervision of your mentor. These are great accomplishments you put in your portfolio and that you showcase to employers. - Mentorship: Speaking of which, the supervision by your mentor is probably the greatest feature of the course (and why the price is a bit high). For those who need someone to look over their shoulder, it's definitely a great resource that helps you move forward in the course. The mentorship I received was great and from what I heard, bad experience with mentors is quite rare. Plus you can always change, if it gets really bad.- Career: The career services they offer are equally useful. By helping you build your résumé, your LinkedIn profile, etc... Springboard helps you reach out and makes your profile more attractive to employers. The mock interviews you need to pass in order to complete the course are ideal reflections of real career situations.- Flexibility: While it is not something obvious when you start, you can actually ask for pauses, freezes and extensions if you need more time to complete the curriculum, or if you dealing with too much stuff a time in your professional / personal life (I assume they don't openly advertise that because they prefer you to finish the certification in a reasonable amount of time). I personally extensively used those (mostly because of how busy I was with my Ph.D. work, specially when it came down to my thesis defense). I eventually completed the program in 12 months. However, I DO NOT recommend to do so within such a big time frame. 6-8 months is definitely reasonable if you allocate the proper time each week. If you trail like I did, Springboard eventually starts charging you for additional extensions.Cons:- Rates: their rates are a bit high in my opinion and I believe it's mostly because of the number of resources they offer (mentors, career advisors, extensive curriculum, access to external resources like DataCamp). It's good to have that many resources, but in my opinion, some parts of the curriculum (maybe less than 10%) are useless or redundant. Therefore, I think the rates (assuming you avoid enrolling in paid extensions) could be 10% cheaper than what they currently are.- Customer Service: this definitely has been the worst part of the whole program. I assume it's because Springboard has considerably increased its volume of students (across all tracks) but their personnel's size hasn't keep up with the trend. While I always eventually obtained the information I requested, it takes a while to find and reach out to the proper person. First of, they only allow email communications. Then, their services are split between advisors, support team, finance team, etc... So if you ask for something to someone, they will most likely re-direct you to someone else. And the response time can be a few days. I don't expect every customer rep. to know everything and I assume it takes a while to train, but it is quite frustrating when you can't get a straight answer immediately, specially for finance-related questions or for deadlines (when you need an answer fast).Read Less"

But just the certificate itself doesn't worth shit.Ironhack: 2/10, same as above, but since you can only learn less, you can't show up more.Career support:Learning portals: usually close to 0Ironhack: I did not attend this, i was disappointed enough in the 10 weeks. I don't expect anything big, the only 'alumni' they could get to talk to us as previous student was a super lowlvl job(the guy was cool though so no offense there).This could be said about all courses and bootcamps on the world, but from online courses you can get refunds super easily if you dont like something, so its easier to select out the trash. With bootcamps you pay thousands of dollars with no hope of a refund if its shit.TLDR: Overall experience:I'm not sure what I expected from this, I was new to the field and wanted to jump in somehow, just learning a few hours every now and then was not really effective. So in a way it was good, because I spent the time on learning, not on playing games etc. Also i did not have to work during the 10 week with full salary because of covid. So i only regret it halfsy.Don't do any bootcamps if you can sit down by yourself to study/read stuff. The only reason to pick a bootcamp is because you can't get yourself to sit down and learn. If you can, online learning is the way.Oh i almost forgot: Teachers, TAs and job supporters were many times late and cancelling appointments(during full lockdown, they were working from home but cancelled the hours!!)Read Less"

There are tons of practice tasks from the very beginning with increasing difficulty. The theoretical parts are clearly written and followed by exercises and real life projects. All exercises and projects pretty challenging so you can feel the growing confidence after completing it. All projects are get checked by an industry professionals. They provide really valuable feedback. Sometime you may need to correct and resubmit the project several times until it is done correctly and accepted by reviewer. During the program, I completed 12 projects and one additional project, so the portfolio is pretty impressing. Another great part of the program are biweekly webinars. During the webinar, students could see the how the data analyst works on different real life problems and real time coding sessions. The webinars give more live interactions to the program.The program teaches all technical and soft skills needed to junior data analyst: - Python programming language with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, etc. - Jupiter Notebook- SQL queries and data processing- Data preprocessing with Python- Exploratory and statistical data analysis- Business analytics and A/B test- Data visualization (graphs and dashboards) with Python libraries and Tableau- Automation and machine learning basicsAs a student, I feel constant support from the Practicum team: community managers, mentor, technical support and from fellow students. You can ask any question in the chat and get needed help pretty fast. Sometimes there could be some time lag because the team can be located in the other part of the world but technical support helps really fast anyway.I also need to mention the career support program where student can get various help with resume writing, portfolio preparation, attend webinars with technical recruiters and career couches and much more. To make the program even more appealing, I would make some suggests:* I would add kind of ""tutor-on-duty"" to answer the questions of the students from the different time zones. Sometimes, I got stuck in some tasks and could not move forward. I had to wait the help from my tutor till the next day because of the time difference. It could be pretty annoying for people with the packed schedules. * It would be very useful to have both way communication with the reviewer. * Also, after completion of the projects, it would be very interesting to see other students' projects or best projects from the previous cohorts. Thank you Yandex Practicum Team for the great program, for the opportunity to be part of the great community, and opportunity to grow as a professional.Read Less"

My career coach sesions didn't help me find a job or make any progress in that area, it was my persistancy and detemination, and strong personality that got me a job.

Instead of just blindly applying for jobs posted on job boards, I was taught more methodically profound approach (which hopefully I can testify with a success in the near future).The cons - it's quite overwhelming. Unless you have DS background or similar, you would need to work hard to get as much as possible from this program. For me personally, it was quite too much at times. I allocated times after finishing the program to actually review / relearning data science from other articles to sharpen my data science skills. Do you have to do the same? probably not.

Now I'm taking the first part of the course, about 20 hours into the coursework and it is basically the prep course all over, yet I have to pass it all to get the certificate. That's fine though because they have the ""job guarantee"" and that's why I chose Springboard over the other choices. I applied and am accepted into their course, then a week or two later I pay for the course, a whopping $7500, though if I'm guaranteed a job, that's well worth it! This is where the sneaky fine print comes in again... The nearly two weeks in between being accepted and paying, they could have called me to talk about the ""job guarantee, but waited until after I paid.

I really like the concise content of the lessons - structured around solving a particular problem and I love the message window that pops up after getting the right solution. How well thought that these messages are not saying the same thing over and over again, such as 'Correct' or 'Well done', but they make reference to the topic I study at that moment and summarize the results in a creative way. These messages put smile on my face. I also like that there are diverse range of examples for the tasks, so there is something of interest for everyone (regardless whether you are a movie fan, marketing analyst, or social media devote, there is something you have knowledge on, so that motivates you more to solve the tasks and see what the results are). In addition, I feel that I am part of a great community that is always there to help. I have asked for help on fb, on slack, directly on the learning platform and the whole team is so friendly and makes me feel that I am not bothering them and that they are always available for the students.

Springboard teaches the fundamentals, but students must take the initiative after the course to continually practice and learn to handle exceptions that were not covered in the course.

I became more confident and learned more after internships with data that required mining and cleaning than simply by focusing on concepts in class. If Springboard incorporates an internship, then it would be excellent! The mentors come from the industry and have worked at major companies like Hewlett Packard. Career coaches have worked in a variety of industries as recruiters. So, their advice can be helpful. Everyone wants you to succeed. So, it was a positive experience.

424,brainstation,Data Science Certificate Course,4.5,"I've had good experiences with Brainstation. I've now taken both their Data Science and Machine Learning certificate programs, and I'll be commenting on the Data Science one here. First off, the instructors I've had have been top notch. Andrew was my... Read More instructor this go round, and it was evident that this guy works data science for a living. You can tell by the way he codes, changes code on the fly at such speed, and debugs code when it's not working. He also seems to be genuinely enchanted with Data Science as a whole. He answered all questions, even my dumb questions, clearly and cleanly. The course content itself is solid. I highly recommend you know Python prior to taking this course, rather than just knowing a programming language in general. Everything is coded in Python from day 1, to include using some more ""advanced"" features like list comprehensions, so having a good grasp of Python I think is integral to your experience with these courses. The only thing I really wasn't high on in the course content was the Statistics section; it's simply too large and broad of a topic to cover in the scope of this course. In my opinion, a basic statistics background should already be had before jumping into Data Science. Most classes and topics are like that, but the statistics portion really stuck out to me. Jupyter notebooks are provided, so the material is flexible and easy to work with. The instructors provide solutions-included notebooks after the lessons, which is handy for someone like me that wants to watch them work the problems and then figure them out in my own manner later. Due to the nature of these part-time courses, and the material covered in such a short time, don't expect to just listen to lectures and be good at Data Science. You will need to work through the Jupyter notebooks on your own time, and do additional research on your own as well. This should be expected for anyone who has ever coded before, but for those who might think it's a sit back and learn it all class, it's not that easy. A hanging point for some people is that there's no 'job guarantee' or assistance with BrainStation. To those folks, I ask you do you truly believe that you're going to get a dream job out of a bootcamp's career assistance or guarantees? I think it's a worthless perk for the average student because you're going to have to know your stuff to be successful in the field anyway, and if you don't know your stuff, you're probably not going to stay in that job long even if it's given to you. It may work out for some, but I didn't see it as a requirement. Overall, I would recommend BrainStation to others, particularly if your company is willing to help with the tuition.Read Less"

428,practicum-bootcamp,Data Scientist,4.3,"My experience taking Practicum’s Data Scientist program has been spectacular so far! Frankly, I was not sure I would enjoy learning on my own but Practicum’s structure has allowed me to finally grasp things I have seen in other courses and Youtube videos... Read More but never really understood. I think there are 4 reasons why: the focus on hands-on practice, the content, support, and deadlines. As a student, you have to constantly test your knowledge through small tasks and after each module, do projects that look holistically at what was learned so far. The content is non-intimidating (love the cute illustrations!) and simple to understand. No fancy words! The focus is on helping grasp the concept. There is a lot of support from Practicum’s tutors and community manager but also from other students. Somehow I feel like we are part of a group trying to achieve something together despite working individually, helping each other when needed and celebrating each other’s win. Finally, I thrive in having a plan of action to learn and Practicum facilitates this through a mix of realistic soft and hard deadlines to help you stay on track. Now, I can’t see myself ever taking an in-person bootcamp as I remember how often things would go over my head and I didn’t have the space and time to grasp a concept before moving on. To Practicum..

Read More while bearing in mind my background in philosophy and interest in AI Ethics: Rigor in the field, plus a way to tie it to the mental model I already had about the world. I was lucky to have found a mentor (Ben!) who did exactly that in my time at Springboard. Especially great, too, is their unlimited mentors option -- a half hour/day, every day, for the entire time you're part of the program. I used that liberally to cover the gaps, ask deeper questions, and find resources that were off-curriculum. Springboard's curriculum is mostly public-domain, and I appreciated most of the resources they provided. DataCamp isn't very helpful to learning to code, in the end (try learning French only by being given full sentences, with a single word missing in each sentence you have to fill in -- not gonna happen). The notebooks they provided were mostly good. Sometimes they were unhelpful to learning this or that concept, although the team was rapid to help out. Here's my recommendation to Springboard: Give the option for students to do e.g. four capstones after Unit 6 (the guided capstone they have us do), rather than walk through the whole curriculum. If they opt to do four capstones, make the rest of the curriculum optional -- they'd simply be resources to help students out on their capstones. The capstones would then have to be approach-specific, e.g. do a capstone that works with a time series, or NLP, in order to get credit for the capstone. I suggest this because I find that I learned a LOT when I worked on my capstones, because they related to topics I cared about, and sincerely wanted to understand -- more, in fact, than I ever did plodding through DataCamp or lectures that didn't necessarily interest me. I think that'd also be better for student portfolios -- it shows they're self-motivated and can actively produce multiple projects on a diverse array of subjects/problems within Data Science. Just my two cents. IMO it's an idea worth piloting. I didn't graduate through their job guarantee (or get a job ultimately related to data science), so I've left the ""Job Support"" section blank. Overall, extremely grateful to have gone through the program. I learned a lot and I know I'll apply my knowledge in unexpected places &amp; ways.

448,springboard,Data Analytics Career Track,4.7,"I enrolled in Springboard’s Data Analytics Career Track upon completing a two-year contract with Teach For America. I always had an interest in data but never felt confident in acting on it until I had to figure out my next step after teaching. I studied... Read More international relations and communication/writing in my undergraduate career so had no formal quantitative experience upon applying. From the moment I applied to Springboard, everything was incredibly professional and straightforward. In fact, after submitting my application, a recruiter called me within 5 minutes to talk about my interest - completely opposite of another boot camp I was considering who didn’t even contact me despite confirming an appointment. This quickness made me think they were desperate, but the recruiter wasn’t pushy but friendly and even gave me an informal interview to make sure I was someone who really wanted to sign up. After that call, I was required to take a roughly one-hour long quantitative aptitude test to further verify that data analytics was a path I could reasonably pursue. I mention this because I was worried that I would fall trap to simply enrolling into a program that took anyone and everyone who signed up. In truth, I’m not sure if they decline students from enrolling either way, but I felt confident that this interview and assessment were evidence that they were at least slightly selective in their admissions process. Curriculum The curriculum is mostly a curation of online resources. These resources come from YouTube videos, articles, and other websites related to business and data analytics. A couple of units are specifically dedicated to business education like economics, financial analysis, statistics, accounting, and other business fundamentals. The cycle of the projects also follows that of a typical data analyst workflow, somewhat similar to the scientific method in crafting a hypothesis, gathering data, exploration, etc. I found these concepts helpful as I was someone who steered away from anything business-related up to that point; I simply had no interest back then. Most of the projects simulate a real-world project utilizing the things you learned earlier in the unit. These are not typically from online resources and are created by Springboard. Given that I don’t have real-world experience with these kinds of projects, it’s hard for me to stack them up against practicality, but they tended to help structure my capstone projects which require you to make up your own project and find the data for it, so it was helpful in that regard. Otherwise, sometimes the projects were poorly worded and it could be slightly cumbersome in finding out exactly what you were supposed to do. But these were usually minor and you could always clarify with your mentor or other students about the assignments and get clarification. They also release new versions of the curriculum to improve a particular assignment, section, or even whole unit based on student feedback so they really try to be responsive to what’s working and what’s not for students. Towards the final stages of the curriculum, you’re required to do a series of interviews that would mimic a real interview you would get. For example, you do a behavioral interview, a presentation interview in which you create a presentation from a project in the course and give that presentation as if you were “working” for the organization, and a technical interview in which they ask you questions about statistics, business, SQL, or whatever else might come up in a real technical interview. Your career coach helps you prepare for these, mostly the behavioral ones as they aren’t data specialists themselves but you can also do preparation with your mentor to prepare for these. They are pass/fail. You’re given a couple of opportunities to pass it but if you fail too many times then you have to redo a couple of units I believe. At first, I found this kind of scary, but the pressure it adds to those interviews is really helpful in simulating what it will be like when you’re doing real interviews. They tend to be anxiety-inducing, you’ll be nervous, and the stakes are higher. The fact that they try to build this pressure into these mock interviews was pretty cool now that I reflect on it. At the time I didn’t think it was that cool! But if you’re someone who struggles with interviews, these mock runs are helpful not only in getting practice but also feedback from those interviewers. They go into detail about how you could do better or other things to think about when you get to a real interview. Mentors and Community Each student is assigned a mentor who is a data analyst/scientist in the field. You have weekly calls with them and they’re mostly there to guide you through the curriculum but you can always talk to them about other things like job searching or how they use tools/techniques in their own jobs, etc; at least my mentor was open to talking about whatever. I hadn’t ever come across anyone who had a bad experience with their mentor, but it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. My mentor was incredibly relaxed, easy to talk to, and helpful when I needed help in the curriculum or needed encouragement on something I found difficult. One thing that made me like my mentor more was also his ability to sometimes question minor details in the curriculum. I appreciate someone who can point out weaknesses in something even though they’re part of the organization itself. It let me know that this person I was assigned to by Springboard wasn’t necessarily a 100% kool-aid drinking member of the club, but an independent person who, though still agreed the curriculum was a good one, was capable of sometimes saying “well I’m not sure I would do it that way but it’s valid.” Upon being accepted into the program, you are also invited to the Slack channel for your specific course. This is where you can communicate with other students in the course who are all at different stages of the curriculum, though you do have a channel for people who are in your specific cohort. There are also Springboard faculty in the channel as well, including a person who helped write the curriculum. They are really helpful in clarifying kinks in assignments or helping students who are having a difficult time on something. There are also various channels for different types of things like job searching, motivation, resources, recorded lectures, and all types of things. Throughout the curriculum, you also have career units in which you learn strategies about job searching. You’re also allowed to choose a career coach, who appears to be contracted with Springboard (I could be wrong about this) to provide 30-minute coaching sessions. These range from resume critiques, to mock interviews, to general strategies, to sharing resources, and really anything that they feel would be helpful to you. You also aren’t required to stick with one career coach, you can always select from a whole list of people at any point and they have descriptions of their background to give you a sense of what to expect. I stuck with the same one the entire time because I didn’t feel the need to talk to a different coach. The Job Search The job search process was not a totally pleasant one, as anyone who has gone through it can attest. But my career coach and the Springboard community in Slack were really helpful. You could see where other people were struggling as well and my career coach would always give helpful suggestions or resources to help in my search. I applied to a little over 90 jobs and had 3 total interviews. Again, I don’t have any kind of formal background in data, business, or STEM besides the Springboard certificate and some projects to showcase my aptitude, so I felt that that was a bit of a barrier for me. Despite this, I did get a job! A friend of my partner referred me to a role at her company which landed me the interview. My career coach did a mock interview with me, reviewed Google Docs that I drafted interview responses to, and answered any other questions I had during the process. I can honestly say my experience in the boot camp really gave me a leg up. They loved that I had that experience and projects to show for it. During the final round of interviews for this role, I had a technical assessment and didn’t do too hot on it, but I was able to redeem myself by talking intelligently about my projects in the course. I think this made me come across as someone who understood general concepts and use cases for specific things and even if I lagged on the technical assessment, I was someone who could get better quickly. My title isn’t “data analyst” but “marketing specialist.” Much of the role is data related though and even though some of it isn’t, it allows me to use skills that I’ve built over the years in undergrad and as a teacher so I’m not 100% shifted into a totally new technical profession. The other roles I interviewed for were pure data analyst jobs though. I made it to either the final or next to final rounds in those interviews and made some mistakes that I think cost me the job. You learn from these though, and your career coach will help you diagnose what happened and how you can do better the next time. I finished the course in mid-November and just recently got a job offer on March 29, so a little over 4 months after completing the course. Another cool thing that Springboard offers is post-completion assistance. You’re allowed to meet with another mentor who can help you be accountable for keeping your skills alive and building more projects to showcase to prospective employers. You have access to this mentor until you get a job and can be really helpful when you complete the course and then start to find that your skills are slipping. A Potential Downside One potential downside to this track might be the curriculum. Though this downside is innate in the way the course is structured. It’s set up as a part-time, 6-month learning experience. They want you to get familiar with a wide range of tools that you could potentially use in a data analyst job, mostly the more popular ones as there are TONS of tools that you could potentially use in the field. In this regard, there’s more breadth than depth in the things you’ll learn. They are still helpful. After a unit and a project, you can honestly say that you’re proficient in that tool or concept. You’ll also learn that each tool could be its own 6-month course. If you haven’t used Microsoft Excel professionally before, or maybe you have, you find out that Excel is more powerful than what you were familiar with. This was the case for me anyway. I’m not sure that any boot camp can really overcome this downside though when the curriculum itself is designed to be completed in a relatively short period of time. You might become interested in diving deeper into a tool after completing a unit on it, but have to move on to the next tool introduced in the next unit. This is just part of being in tech. I recommend seeking other online resources if you become really interested in getting better at a particular tool. However, I still believe, along with many other practitioners, that the curriculum is still helpful in allowing you to understand the essentials and then get a job with them. In Conclusion I think the number one thing that you get out of the course is structure and community. Of course, you could learn everything in any boot camp online for free, but you to be someone who can muster the discipline and structure to stick to it long-term. I have a habit of constantly looking for new resources to learn from, even after finding what seems like a good one, I’ll complete half of it and then start looking for something else. Springboard’s curriculum allowed me to stay on course and I trusted that what they put in front of me was going to be helpful in learning and ultimately getting a job. The frequent connection with my mentors, career coach, and other students was really helpful in knowing that I wasn’t alone. It gave me a psychological edge in that someone I was meeting with at the end of the week was expecting me to complete assignments and be able to discuss them. This was a total career pivot for me and, so far, I’m glad that I did it. I welcome any questions about my experience and the program!Read Less"

453,springboard,Data Science Career Track,4.7,"Springboard is one of the more affordable data science bootcamps ($7500 upfront cost, compared to $10k or even $18k in some other bootcamps). They're able to do this by not having in-person lecturers. The curriculum is completely online, self-paced. Much... Read More of the curriculum is actually videos and articles from other online resources (see ""Cons"" below). But they make up for this by their mentorship program (see ""Pros"" below). On the surface, this looks like a really good deal--it's cheaper than other bootcamps, it's self-paced, and you get a tuition refund guarantee if you don't find a job within 6 months of graduating. However, in practice, when you have a 6-month deadline (instead of in-person classes with an instructor to keep you accountable on a daily basis), it can be really easy to fall behind. Fortunately Springboard has a number of student advisors and other support staff who can help with setting a schedule for you to follow and giving you extensions (both of which I've used). But I think the people who can best thrive in this kind of program are those who can set clear goals for themselves on a weekly basis, in spite of all the other things going on in their lives. I had a lot of trouble balancing my bootcamp assignments with my daytime job and family obligations (your job and familial needs will feel very immediate while the bootcamp feels less urgent because of the 6-month deadline), and I quickly fell behind and needed extensions. This might all sound very obvious, but it's something that I and others I know often overlook. If you're not the kind of person to set hard deadlines for yourself, don't do a self-paced bootcamp. But if you are, and you don't mind not having an in-person instructor, then Springboard is for you. Pros: The mentorship program is the highlight of this bootcamp. Every student is matched with a mentor who they meet with once per week, 30 minutes at a time. You can also schedule additional unlimited 1:1 mentor calls with any mentor that's available, but I've found my weekly mentor to be the biggest help. I was able to ask my mentor for guidance on capstone projects, discuss questions I had about the mathematics behind certain algorithms, and ask for career advice (they are people in the industry, so they have insight on the field and job searches and whatnot). Springboard also has career coaches to help us with job searches, but it's still helpful to hear directly from the mouth of a person in the industry. Cons: Much of the curriculum is material that you can find on your own online (like articles on medium.com). Springboard organizes it all into a nice package for you, with many of their own project assignments sprinkled throughout, but this can make some of the material feel disjointed since it's a conglomeration of many different sources put together. Springboard goes through many updates with their curriculum though, so they've been making improvements to their assignments and curricula. To sum it up: you get what you pay for; Springboard is one of the more affordable bootcamps, but they're able to keep the price low by not building their whole curriculum from scratch and instead using other resources already available on the web.Read Less"

Read More one I was most interested in. Short after I started the full program I discovered a passion for data science I didn’t know that I had. The coursework was beyond expectations. They didn’t assume you had knowledge of all the math behind algorithms and they didn’t use terminology that only professional mathematicians would know. They only skills you need to bring to this course are problem solving and googling. If you can do that effectively than you will make it through this course. During the course they offer coursework to prepare for applying for jobs however I found it hard to balance that with my main coursework and my full time job. But you can wait until after graduation and they are still there to help you prepare. They do not put you in contact with employers directly but they do show you great way to contact them yourself. The amount of job support you get is good for the price of the course and great when you consider they don’t have any ISAs or anything like that.

It has helped me learn more efficiently in grad school by focusing my learning on industry relevant things. Make sure to develop a good relationship with your mentor and utilize on-demand mentors frequently to get unstuck when coding new concepts.Read Less"

486,springboard,Data Science Career Track,5.0,"There's so much to be said about how Springboard does an amazing job with the Data Science Career Track! 1)The curriculum is so thoughtfully and expertly designed. It manages to cover a wide range of topics, but in a manner that flows naturally both in... Read More terms of progressive difficulty and logical continuity. This to me, is so important for sustaining motivation to complete the program. 2)It is highly hands-on and project oriented. This is a good thing, always a good thing, and Springboard recognizes that. Almost every unit has at least one mini-project to explore the content covered in that unit within an implementation context. You also need to complete two Capstone projects of your choice in any areas of your interest as part of the curriculum, and these projects are great for your Github or your resume. Clearly, Springboard appreciates that project-oriented learning is essential to drive certain concepts home and again, sustain motivation by seeing the fruits of your labor. 3)The quality of the resources. Data Science experts on the Springboard Team have put in efforts to create high quality resources - both technical and career-oriented. These are usually well-drafted informational documents or videos. They also handpick a good selection of public articles/videos (and even one wonderful book) to supplement your learning, and their partnership with DataCamp (shoutout!) gives you access to a rich library of also high quality content. 4)Flexibility Look, Springboard gets that life happens, and they've got your back. There is an option to take a 2-3 week pause from the course ANYTIME to perhaps catch up on other responsibilities or to maybe just *recharge*. Also, they offer a free 2 month extension to finish the program if you don't finish within the original 6 months, which can also turn out to be quite a blessing. I'm a full-time CS student at UCLA, so when I ran into a difficult quarter, I could still manage because of their flexible options. 5)Community You're assigned a Student Advisor and Mentor as part of the program, and in my experience, they were both wonderful. The Student Advisor regularly checks in on you if you need help making goals, being productive, planning a schedule, tackling burnout, and more! They really help keep you afloat during your journey. You meet with your mentor on a weekly basis so they can guide you with projects and difficult material, or tell you more about the industry and their type of work, which is always interesting to hear! My mentor was super helpful with his feedback on my projects and helped me shape them into something I was proud of. I should also mention that support on their Slack is pretty good too for Q/A related things, their customer support team is extremely friendly and helpful, and their cohort of career coaches are also excellent, so be sure to make regular appointments with them because they give extremely valuable and insightful advice about the industry and building the professional profile you want for yourself. All-in-all, a great program designed by a talented team of industry professionals. The amount of knowledge and learning you get out of the program is priceless (and you get lifetime access to the curriculum!). If you've got the time and you want to, as they call it, ""future-proof"" your career, I highly recommend their program :)Read Less"

That's when I found Practicum by Yandex among all the bootcamps available online. Fast forward 6 months later, I just had my final projects approved and also successfully completed two company projects in the meantime. It has been such enjoyable and rewarding learning experience, not without its challenges which I value equally, if not more. I appreciate every aspect of the course: the design of the learning platform, the community support, the projects I worked on, and the people I've got to know. I can't say enough good things about the course. There are two things I'm most impressed by the course. One is the comprehensive support we had. The community manager, instructors and tutors are there really supporting the students to get the most out of the course. I'm not sure how they did it but the platform online support is 24/7! Whenever I got stuck with a task, I sent an inquiry via the platform tech support, the response is almost straightaway from real people, despite all the time differences. That's very impressive and helpful! Another is the opportunity to work on projects for real companies. These are the most challenging because the data we worked with are a lot more complex in terms of both structure and sources, and there are lots of contextual factors to take into account in the process of analysis as well. So the learning never stops, and working on these projects to help the companies to achieve their business goals has been very rewarding experience. In brief. I highly recommend the course to anyone who are thinking of either consolidating their knowledge in data analytics or learning new skills.Read Less"

It's definitely something you need to put in the time for so working full or part time while taking this course is a bit tough - unless you think you can handle it.

There are long stretches of the curriculum where all you're doing is watching videos of talks, lectures, etc. If this is not a good learning style for you, definitely consider something else.

I was given an entry test to see where I feel on being at least well equipped to do well in the course. I passed it with no problem. I told them that although I passed, I still wasnt 100% comfortable and I felt like I needed more practice because they were concepts that I havent reviewed in years. They allowed me to take a 6 week course, prior to school beginning that enabled me to feel more confident. This preliminary course was $400. However, they told me that if I completed the course, then I would be refunded the $400. So if that's not a heck of an incentive to complete, then I dont know what is. Also, they have a mentor program and a mentor call once a week to ensure that the concepts are being understood and they also have a weekly Q &amp; A session.

506,springboard,Data Science Career Track,4.7,"About me - BA in Mathematics with an emphasis in Statistics from a State University (2019). 3.0 GPA -28 years old at the time -No internships, relevant work or volunteer experience in the tech field. In fact, my general work experience was 3 years at... Read More Mcdonalds, then 7 at a Resort as a bartender. -Spent 30-50 hours a week studying. 10-20 hours a week working on my resume, cover letter, connections, and job searching. -Got a job offer and accepted an entry level Data Scientist position at about 4-5 months into the program. Currently still in after 3 months, love it. Pros: -Springboard itself is great and has a lot of the materials needed to learn the basics of DS. The reading/videos/coding can be tiresome at time, but just take it one step at a time and you'll near the end eventually. Take good notes and read every single line, do as much as the coding as you can but don't spend too much time on it, spend more time on your capstones as these are what will probably make or break your chances of landing a DS position. Make a daily/weekly schedule to make sure you complete the program on time. I recommend 5-7% completion every week, at least for the first couple of months. It will get harder as you go and you will suffer burnout too. But if you could accomplish more early on when you're still full of energy, then you'll have some room to slow down or take a break later on in the course if needed. -Mentors are smart and always there if you need something -Career coaches are great. I recommend getting to know them early on as I feel like besides learning the DS skills itself, this part of the program was the most beneficial. Unfortunately, if you're like me with a not so pretty background, the coaches might hit you with some reality that you will most likely become a Data Analyst first before ever becoming a DS. But if you run into one that truly cares, they can help you out so much. I attribute my current DS position to my career coach's help. So while all the career coaches are great and helpful, if you can find one where you see that they truly care about you and your job search, I recommend making a connection with that person and making as much calls to them as possible. -Cost is relatively doable for the bootcamps I've looked at so far. The payment options are nice as well -Customer service is excellent and quick to answer any questions Cons -Not sure if this is a true con, but many of study materials are free or attainable with a subscription fee. But that can be said about most schools too so. What's great is the structure and how one can learn the materials through repetition even though the beginning may be quite confusing. -Signed up for DS career track, but was told by many, except one, that I will most likely land a DA role before getting a DS position. Although that one person did help me beat the odds and get a DS position even though I've no true experience. But this is rare apparently, and requires dedication. -There's not too much cons about Springboard itself.... Overall, if you stick to Springboard and can push yourself then you'll succeed. Springboard is a great bootcamp that helped launched my career and can yours as well.Read Less"

That being said, the course absolutely helped me achieve my objective of creating a comprehensive mental model of the data analytics process; something I had known in many different parts over my career and the curriculum helped me to assemble into a comprehensive whole. I am confident in my ability to leverage data analytics to solve business problems, and extract value from data. The entire career track is a not-insignificant time commitment, and can definitely be challenging at parts (something I consider a good thing). You have regular mentor meetings which were very helpful to me in staying on track and collaborating on different ideas for the capstone projects. I liked how the curriculum pulled a variety of sources together and focused on practical examples.

The curriculum is structured like a real tech company where you train on the platform for a week or two and work on a project the next week. After completing the first free sprint, I was hooked. I fell in love with the platform so much that I was coding at any free time I have. If your goal is to learn to code for real, think like a data scientist or analyst, then Practicum by Yandex is for you. My favorite part of the program is the project and code review. It can also be the annoying part because project review can take two to three cycle with corrections back and forth with your reviewer. At the end when your project is approved, there is that satisfaction that comes from achieving a feat. I love the weekly webinars on different topics in data science and the fact that you can connect with your tutors and peers through a common slack channel. My coding has improved from the live coding section with tutors. I believe that I am truly on my way to becoming a data scientist. I am currently in the 10 sprint but I already have some interviews lined up based on the strength of my portfolio. There is the optional career development at the end of the program for the US market with job guarantee but I haven't gotten there yet to see how good it is but I can tell you, with the strength of what I have done so far, getting a job shouldn't be a problem.Read Less"

The Career mentoring seemed beneficial for someone unexperienced with the job search or network building. I did feel like the calls I did were good but were lacking. This was not the mentors fault in my opinion. They most likely have to big of a work load. This comes out in how rushed the call feels and the mentor can not take extra time to really connect with the student and flesh out the purpose of the call. This also forces some of them to stick to there script to hit all their points during the call. I will say the mentors that I used were friendly and informative. There's also a on call support team that will help you whenever you get stuck. I only used it once but it was nice to have available.

My mentor provided helpful feedback and advice for lot of the machine learning methods I tried and gave me a starting point to work on the project. Cons: Many parts of Springboard curriculum is just reading articles on data science or youtube recordings which can be find online. The video/audio quality was not the best. I think it would have been much better for Springboard to make some videos covering perhaps similar material but improve audio and video quality and create a more cohesive curriculum instead of many seemingly unrelated videos. Also, none of the assignments have answer keys provided to students, so there are not many ways to check your work. The machine learning unit's videos and assignments are almost entirely taken from a college class. The ad hoc projects were useful to get practical examples to refer to, but a few lectures from the class did not feel adequately sufficient to develop a good understanding of machine learning concepts and AI techniques.Read Less"

540,ironhack,Data Analytics Bootcamp,1.0,"Dear Leadies and Gentelmen, I will share with you my terrible experience with Ironhack hoping that it will be useful to you and that you will not make the mistake I made. I also read a lot of reviews and saw very few negative ones, even ignoring them... Read More thinking that these were just exceptions, people who did not want to learn something new. But now I know they were people telling the truth. I don't want to offend anyone, I just see Ironhack as a service provider and I evaluate it as I see it. So let's begin! 1. The Teacher – Ignacio Soretas He can't speak English properly! He has a hard time understanding what we said, of course, I understand that English is not his mother language, but this is not just about pronunciation, it’s about the word combination he uses. He just lacks the ability to explain, to express himself correctly. Also, if you ask him a question, either verbal or written, he cannot understand what you are asking him, he cannot answer the question. It happened very often we asked him the same question in 1283091238901 different ways, just to understand what we are asking him and he again either says that he does not understand the questions or starts talking nonsense. Things that have nothing to do with the question. Example: Question: Hey Ignacio, how to clean this data? Answer: It’s very important to clean your data. OR I don't understand what you're asking ################################################################################################# It flows from topic to topic. Very often while talking about one topic he turns to another or goes back explaining some things he forgot to say, but we talked about them 2 hours ago and now he remembered to say them. Let me give you a similar example that will help us understand what I mean. Let's imagine that we have a task to cook a pizza. I guess most of the people reading this post know how to cook pizza and that's why I chose this example. Here's how Ignacio Soretas would explain how to cook a pizza. Example: Once you bought the dough from the store now roll it out and start making a pizza, then Michael Jackson was a very famous singer of the time, I forgot to tell you that he had no children, take the pizza out of the oven and eat. This was an example that contained words and objects that are close to our daily lives. It was easy to detect the catch, but now imagine he is talking about stuff you hear for the first time like data analysis, statistics etc... It’s impossible to understand what he means, but he left you with confusion with many questions. ################################################################################################# 2. Curriculum The simplest and most basic things we all need to know we’re not explained. Things like how to create a table (Data Frame) in Pandas (Python library used to operate with data). How to fill this table with information. How to change the values in the table and other basic stuff. The biggest downside is that they didn't teach us to THINK like a data analyst, they didn't teach us how to ask questions and how to check them, through the data, how to clean data, and many many more. ################################################################################################# Also, the exercises we had to do were not well structured and are not suitable for beginners. Task descriptions are very bad, it is difficult to understand what they want from us even for a person who is a native English speaker. Very often the exercises included tasks that were not adequate for everyday life. Things that have nothing to do with us. Difficult to assimilate and thus further complicate the understanding of the task. For example, things like some Pokemons and similar cartoon characters. We had the task to process a table with the characteristics of Pokemon and draw conclusions about them. Like ‘Who is the strongest Pokemon?’. As you can guess for people who have never seen this cartoon and have no idea about Pokemon, the difficulty of the task increases. Once because you do not understand what information the table contains and second because you do not understand how the code work, with which you are trying to process the table. It would be much better if the exercises contained things that are much closer to the problems in real life, things that we encounter every day, such as tables with information about food and so on. ################################################################################################# The lectures were nothing more than reading aloud, and there was nothing of added value. Not to mention that there were days when the lectures lasted about 4-5 hours from 9 to 14:00 in the afternoon and after such a long listening nothing remains in your head. The information should be conveyed in small steps and at small intervals, not a lot of information together. ################################################################################################# Often they said to us that if we had questions we should ask Google or our teammates and if we failed then we would ask for help from the assistant or the teacher. Well, this brings us automatically to the question if I have to ask my classmates or Google then why did I pay you more than 7K euros? ################################################################################################# SQL is the number 1 required skill to find a job as a data analyst, well we learn it only for one week… but spend 3 weeks in ML doing something that nobody understands, and nobody will hire us to make a model that we don’t understand how they work. Tableau is the number 2 required skill to find a job as a data analyst but we learn it only one day! ONLY ONE DAY, yes you read right ONLY ONE DAY! ################################################################################################# 3. Job support is even worst. I will tell you only that few months later I can’t find a job in the analytics field, and I will end there, hopefully, I helped you to understand what are the hidden costs of taking a Bootcamp at Ironhack. ################################################################################################# Of course, there are many more bullshits around them but yea, that’s enough for now. As a summary! STAY AWAY from IRONHACK! STAY AWAY from IRONHACK! Go to Udemy, Coursera, etc… and remember Data Analytics isn’t a sprint it’s a lifelong journey!Read Less"

Even after I accepted one of the initial offers, more came in. I started the course in January and finished in July. I took multiple breaks which sums up to 2 months. I invested 40+ hours a week in July while working full time job to finish the remaining course. I started the program as a prep student and then took the exam and was admitted into the career track. If you aren’t afraid of challenge, I encourage you to try it out. They have slack community I found helpful throughout my prep course and career track course. As soon as I was admitted into the career track, and understood the basics I started using stack overflow and library documentations more when I need help or trapped. The mentors( meets you 1:1 weekly) also gave me resources that helped me. All of my mentors were working as in an industry in a data science field and gave me up to date information. If you find me on LinkedIn, I will be happy to share more and answer questions you may have about my experience.Read Less"

549,springboard,Data Analytics Career Track,5.0,"I only have Pros with this program. Springboard's bootcamp services are the career counseling support you wish you had in undergrad and never got! The only cons I think would be not understanding that the field of data, analytics, business, tooling, all... Read More of it, is a huge field and there is so much to learn and know. Understand that any bootcamp is creating a foundation of skills. It's really a taster of the field. The bootcamp a great sandbox environment to learn, play, and and test things out in a safe, supportive environment. Pros Curriculum is excellent Numerous touchpoints throughout the bootcamp. --Student Advisor --Dedicated Mentor who guides you through the program --Office hours with a Springboard person --Great Slack network --Mentor on Demand - multiple people --Career Counseling --Several mock interviews both technical and behavioral You are then a part of a really big network full of interesting people who have all kinds of backgrounds. You get a lot of exposure, guidance, and help for troubleshooting. I took the online self-paced full time version. I happened to get a job within the first 8 weeks of the program and took a 4 month pause to onboard to that role and then complete the rest of the bootcamp for the final two months. Everyone was very supportive, patient, and really helped with managing stress, burnout, and motivation. It's really nice to be learning the material in a safe, supportive environment and know that everyone is interested and vested in your success. The curriculum is comprehensive and the resources shared are amazing. Before enrolling in Springboard's program, I tried to create my own bootcamp but it turns out that it is very difficult to find appropriate data when you yourself are outside of a business context (meaning, a lot of data is proprietary). I learned a little bit on my own but the structure and progression of the program is really worth the price tag. It really is an investment and opens your world up to a lot of great networking opportunities and practice. For Tooling, the curriculum follows Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Python. You complete case studies and projects using these tools. Remember that it's the business problem that's driving the tool usage and not the other way around. Be agnostic to tools and solutions, but it's really about the business problem you're solving for. There is also the core skills associated with data analytics and that's the financial perspective, the economic perspective, and the statistical perspective, all underpinned by strategic frameworks. Springboard is like a compressed MBA in this way and jumpstarts your business understanding if you don't already have it. Remember that the bootcamp is creating a strong foundation for you on which to build your data skills. You cannot become a subject matter expert in a matter of months, it does take years, so understanding that is really key as you make a career change.Read Less"

551,practicum-bootcamp,Data Scientist,5.0,"To say that I am happy with my Yandex expierence would be a huge understatement. Having graduated from the Data Scientist (after approx. 9 months), I am stunned with how much I've learned in such a short amount of time, especially considering my background... Read More is not in tech. I signed up for yandex after graduating with a PhD in philosophy; my goal was to use my critical thinking skills in a tech field that would produce tangible results. I began by trying to learn data science on my own, but was quickly overwhelmed by how much there was to learn. Enter Practicum by Yandex. From the very start of this program, we were given modules in 2-week sprints. Each module consisted of a chapter of material we need to review, tasks for each section of the chapter, and a project. The chapter generally took a few days to go through, and the project about one week (with the grading procedure). When completing the projects, the code is scrutinized by practicing data scientists, and they often provide important feedback that may not have been covered in the course material. On the data science track, you start with learning how to program in python and use data analysis libraries. You then move on to conducting data analysis and statistical analysis. During this time, you practice data visualization in your projects and learn how to structure notebooks. Once the data analysis portion of the program is complete, you branch off into machine learning, which I found most interesting. Each module covers some important aspect of machine learning, and each project sees you building your own model, or oftentimes multiple models. With all that I've learned at Yandex, I've been able to participate in data science competitions and have scored in the top 10%. This is something I know I couldn't have done on my own, and for that I am extremely grateful to Yandex. I will say, I was a bit apprehensive at the start of the program because I saw that the price for the bootcamp was quite a bit lower than similar bootcamps; I guess this must be because lower operating costs, because I honestly could not find anything to complain about. They offer great lessons, robust feedback, constant support through Slack, and a genuinely nice community to be a part of. Having just completed the course this week, I was sad to think that I would be leaving the community now. Amazingly, Yandex had something else up it's sleeve - a career resource course. The course covers all the steps necessary to get a job, from writing an in-depth resume, to building a web presence, to mastering the tech interview. As I said, I am very happy that I chose to study with Practicum by Yandex. It was a fantastic experience, and I am extremely grateful for all the guidance and support I received.Read Less"

Before going into the intricacies of the program a brief disclaimer: Practicum by Yandex is online-based and you learn to code by reading the theory / doing exercises on a platform and a practical project after every sprint. The projects are great, covering a wide range of topics and get reviewed and approved by professional Data Analysts who tell you were you went astray and give hints to improve. In my opinion the self-learning works great if you have a job or other studies beside the boot camp but it also means that you have to structure your schedule alone. Other people might prefer classroom learning, but those courses are A) way more pricey and B) do not allow you to study when is best for you (which for me is mostly in the middle of the night). Also, while Practicum has great tutors and a Slack community where you you can post every questions you might have, in the end learning to code is a lonely trial-and-error process because you will only understand the techniques by trying it out yourself. With this out of the way, the curriculum covers what you need: Data cleaning, data visualization in Python and Tableau, statistical tools, some machine learning, the already mentioned web scraping and SQL. Personally I found the course well balanced, but I would recommend to enrich it with one or two Udemy courses or YouTube tutorials where need be - as an Economist I already knew the statistics in the course, but had not worked with data base queries before and did some extra research there. So this might vary, depending on each students' background. To sum it up: If you want a boot camp that gives you maximum freedom and responsibility for your own progress while providing top-notch material and professional feedback on your coding projects - then Practicum might be the right pick.Read Less"

Read More on you and your progress with the assignments however the content was all over the place. I never knew what I was supposed to be reading or working on. My particular mentor was nice and smart but kind of would go on long winded misguided tangents rather than giving me any level of real instruction. I never understood the structure of what I should be doing - and I was working full time and didn’t perhaps give it the level of attention needed. I did not see the program through and dropped out but they still billed me for it all (6,000 if I recall). If you’re looking for tailored instruction this won’t provide that. I ended up quitting my job and later enrolling in a Software Engineering full time boot camp with General Assembly that I found incredibly structured and I excelled. I am now a full stack developer.

Students learn so many concepts in Excel, SQL and Python as well as Tableau and Power BI, but they don't have any access to any pre-designed exercises or third party exercises either. Second, Springboard is terrible when it comes to communicate with students. They never responded back to my messages on their chat features and it always took them more than 48 hours to reply back to my email for simple questions that could be answered in less than an hour! Problem, claiming that it is their policy to keep you waiting for 48 hours because they just can. Third, mentors are not on the same page when it comes to materials and content students have read in their curriculum. I often asked questions from mentor only to hear that he found them challenging! When students decide to embark on an arduous task of learning data, mentors need to patiently work with them and walk them through the steps instead of asking them to GOOGLE IT! How can someone without a background in data can find their answers right away by googling it! Putting minuses aside, this is a good way to enter the data analytics industry.

620,springboard,Data Science Career Track,4.0,"I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering and 2 years of experience working as an engineer. I pursued this course full time, working approximately 30-50 hours a week towards it. I was able to complete the course with Advanced ML Specialization in 5 months.... Read More I now have a job as a Machine Learning Engineer, with a base salary that is 23% higher than my previous salary. I believe that this course is great for people who have a STEM degree and who have some technical work experience or technical project experience. If you do not have these things, I think it would be wiser to either pursue a technical degree or one of Springboard's other courses, such as their DA or DE courses. I rate the coursework three out of five stars. The structure of the coursework was immensely helpful in guiding my journey to learn the steps in the DS/ML workflow, and it kept me organized and disciplined in my studies. The early course material does a good job of explaining the basics of Python, SQL, and the DS workflow. However, the depth of the course material starts to lose its quality in the sections covering statistics, ML algorithms, and the specialization material. There are mini-projects related to the major algorithms (regression, classification, and clustering) and statistical concepts (CLT, AB tests, etc.), however, these sections sometimes skip over critical details that are commonly discussed in technical interviews (such as assumptions of linear regression). Additionally, the ML specialization did not provide projects related to the topics of deployment. Overall I would have liked to see more depth and detail in the later content. I will add that most of the content is either coursework on DataCamp or proprietary Jupyter Notebooks created by Springboard. Many of my peers agreed that the DataCamp coursework does not retain well since they are simple fill-in-the-blank exercises. The notebooks are more useful since they show practical examples of how an algorithm or concept would be applied, but overall the content has a perceived low value since the DataCamp membership can be had for a low price. The mentorship was also hit-or-miss. I was lucky to have a mentor with a background in statistics, so he was able to explain some of the advanced concepts that I really needed help with understanding. Some of my peers had mentors with backgrounds in MLE or analytics, and they were not of much use to my peers. Therefore I would say that the value of the mentor is dependent on luck. I believe that the true value of the course comes in career support, portfolio projects, and the alumni network. Springboard actually does a great job of aggregating good articles for how to pursue a career in DS, how to tailor your resume, and how to network. The career coaches are very experienced in recruiting and HR practices, so they give great advice when it comes to resume design and how to approach interviews. The course also includes mock interviews for behavioral, coding, project presentation, and general DS interviews, which are invaluable in preparing for real interviews. The portfolio projects are vital when it comes to catching the eyes of hiring managers, so I would recommend tailoring those to the companies you want to work for. Most of all, I found value in the alumni network. I was able to secure a couple of interviews easily because I reached out to Springboard alumni at companies that were hiring. I would recommend Springboard to anyone who is looking to change careers, but I would only recommend this DS course for individuals who have a technical background since companies typically look for some form of technical background for this type of role. As mentioned previously, I would recommend individuals with little to no background to pursue another path with a lower barrier to entry, such as Data Analytics or Data Engineering.Read Less"

I just recently completed Springboard’s Data Science Career Track certification program, and here are my pros and cons. Pros:... Read More - Being paired with an expert mentor for the entire duration of the course is incredibly helpful. My mentor pushed me to go deeper beyond the curriculum and helped my projects really shine. - This is my preference, but I appreciate the self-paced online nature of the program, as opposed to live lectures. There are numerous case studies throughout the program that give you a guided opportunity to practice what you just learned, which is really helpful. - The two required capstone projects are great for your portfolio, and really help you see the data science life cycle from end to end. Cons: - The statistics curriculum is really lacking. Having no background in statistics, I found it hard to keep up with as they covered difficult topics superficially with speed. Part of the statistics curriculum is reading a book called “The Art of Statistics”. Unless you have prior background in statistics, this book is not easy to understand. - The program does its best to cover many common machine learning algorithms, but they don’t really go into detail on how the algorithms work. You’ll watch some pre-recorded online lectures from Harvard, but it’s hard to learn from a one-off lecture without really building the fundamentals of how basic algorithms work. I am just beginning my job search, so I cannot speak to the quality of the job support. From what I understand, you meet with a career coach biweekly to help you with your job search. To qualify for the job guarantee, you need to apply to 4 jobs per week and make 7 networking connections per week and do 2 informational interviews per month. They definitely emphasize networking as the main way to get your first job, as opposed to cold applications. All in all, I definitely learned a lot from this program. If you are an independent learner and are OK with taking additional courses on statistics and ML after completion, I would definitely recommend this program.Read Less"

Read More compete with those who has formal specialized education, such as in computer science or data science. While a lack of formal experience through employment is still a problem, it is somewhat alleviated by the hands-on curriculum projects and the projects done after completing the course. In my feeling, completing this course gives you a credibility. There are three main components: career coaching by people experienced in technical recruiting, mentorship by data scientists working in industry, and well organized tutorial materials. In my opinion, it would be very hard for a self-learner to achieve such pace and quality of learning. Having to pay disciplines and ensures a good pace of learning. Not everyone gets a good mentor. My two advices here are: 1) change the mentor if he behaves like he is your boss and only demands, and you need to spend a lot of time just to think what questions are good and bad. This could be OK only in the beginning. 2) Stick to the one who is genuinely willing to help. Springboard allows to switch to another mentor, they have some long-term selection in place. Most career coaches are very helpful, you can meet with them roughly every week. Here my suggestion is to stay organized: write their suggestions and execute on the same day, because otherwise you will find it difficult to get back to it due to a lot of main technical learning which keeps piling up if you are not as organized. Make sure to agree with your family members: they will miss you a lot 6 to 9 months, because they will mostly see your back while you are sitting at the computer. The skills you get are worth it, but there is still a long job search ahead after graduation in most cases. Delve deeply into material, as there are four mock up interviews close to the end of the course. The best ways to prepare for Data Science course is to learn Python, Statistics, and SQL in advance, and try to craft a resume and LinkedIn profile. At the end, you learn how to extend your network, data analysis, and machine learning. Only basic familiarity with statistics and SQL, but there are many resources in the curriculum, which you can use for training, including after graduation. No exposure to cloud techniques, but you will become prepared to play with those on your own. Up to two breaks are allowed, up to 3 weeks each, which helps make it in time if you like to delve deeper or have a lack of prior experience.Read Less"
637,practicum-bootcamp,Data Scientist,5.0,"This is a great program of those unfamiliar with the field. If you are new to the field, like myself, you might find yourself spending more time on each 2 week sprint that what they say, but it is time well spent. The curriculum is great. There is solid... Read More organization, incremental learning, and you will produce tangible projects that display your learning. The slack forum allows conversations between students and the tutors. Tutors will respond within 24 hours as a rule. Sometimes you will run into technical cliches where the right solution is offered, but the automated grader will not accept it, but that is quickly resolved by reaching out to the tutors who will report it to the technical side. While I am just starting with the career accelerator portion of the program (optional), I believe that Practicum will help anyone determined to find a good job by helping with resume prep, interview skills, and soft skills. Indeed, during the 9 months the program integrates soft skills with the technical skills so one should feel well prepared for finding an entry level job at graduation. Initially, the program will guide you every step of the way through the learning materials. As things progress, your tutors will emphasize that you need to start investigating the documentation to find the answers. I believe this mirrors the real world, where your employers will expect you to research things before you ask for help. Overall, a great program that has given me skills and knowledge. I am very grateful for the opportunity to learn from practicum and feel pretty optimistic that I have the skills to contribute to the team of my future employer.Read Less"

You get support from experts in the industry. Before my interview, I needed an urgent guidance for my interview and was able to get timely help from a mentor.

The training is self-paced and all remote, so I was able to complete most of it while traveling the country in my RV.

Read More to an Accounts Receivable Clerk, which I was very pleased with. I directly used the skills I learned from Springboard to leverage myself for a new role within my company. The core strengths and key takeaways I gained from this course was a new approach to structured thinking, a deeper understanding of the importance of networking, and the confidence to become a constant self-learner. Before this course, I had no idea where to begin as a budding data analyst. I had no clue what skills I needed to learn or what those technical skills even did. But, after finishing this course, I now have a clear understanding of what a data analyst does, what the tools of a data analyst are, and what the tools do. Also, now I know how to approach networking with people. Through this course, I gained the confidence I needed to reach out to people for networking, for jobs, for advice, and for help/mentorship. Lastly, Springboard's Data Analytics Career Track program excels due to it's large community of support.

The career hack was full of so many promises but lacked a lot. The career coaches have no clue on how a tech interview takes place nor have they ever applied to any tech job. My 2 cents from the entire experience would be save your money and do some Udemy courses. They are same.
