I enjoyed living there immensely, was able to meet a lot of locals, and lots of great people in general. It's also relatively inexpensive and very walkable.Staff: People are really friendly, and... Read More I want them to succeedInstructors: About half of our instructors were great to fantastic and we learned a ton during their weeks.Class size: We had just 10 people in my cohort and we really felt like a family by the end.Atmosphere: It's very laid back, and a comfortable and safe feeling space.Network: They have a good Barcelona network, which is great if you want to live there and have an EU visa.Job assistance for EU citizens: They have a strong network in Barcelona and can get you interviews. Instructors and speakers will also be looking out for you and helping make connections. However, once my colleagues who are EU-citizens left Barcelona they found that assistance dropped off like a cliff and there was minimal communication. I learned a ton.Cons:Staff: Despite their friendliness, communication was a huge issue. Even before class started, I missed most of the Hangouts because I didn't realize the times were being posted to Slack. Emails were not returned in a timely manner before, during, and after my session. People were defensive when offered feedback. I was often told ""So and so will contact you about your concern."" and then silence.Instructors: Two of our instructors were awful and it felt like they just wasted a week of our time which is a big deal when you are only studying for 6 weeks. We basically had to relearn everything we learned from our first JS teacher. They made up for the bad CSS class by bringing in a great instructor later on, but it meant we lost a day of working on our final project. Curriculum: It was frequently commented by my colleagues that it felt like we were being experimented on too much and I agree with them. We alternated between JS and Ruby instruction and the context switching was very confusing. They started us off the bat with Ruby and OO which was completely overwhelming for most people our first week. Visa sponsorship for non-EU: You will probably not be able to find someone to sponsor you for a visa. I wanted to stay and it seemed like it should be doable (I was one of the strongest students in the cohort), but even though there was some interest ultimately what I heard was it's way too hard to sponsor and very few companies are willing to do it. You are limited to large foreign companies and even then it can take 3 months.Job Assistance: Good or bad depending on your needs. I'm going to move this out of the bullet, so read on below.We lost internet for a few days and last a ton of class time as a result. They didn't have a contingency plan so we had already lost almost two days before they found us a temp new space. Internet was pretty consistently bad the whole time we were there.Job Assistance:They were great while I was still in Barcelona, but as soon as I returned back to the states they went silent. I had previously decided with the cofounder that we would work on Barcelona until I left and then switch to SF. After two weeks of silence (I pinged a couple people during that time), I sent another email and this time they apologized and said it was a new guy's responsibility.I scheduled a Skype call with the new guy and I thought maybe things would improve. Well, he sent me a list of sites with job postings. And then the next week he sent me another email with one more site with a job posting. In the meantime I was adding the jobs I applied to on to a spreadsheet so they could see my progress.I did know that they would have less of a network in the states, but the cofounders are well connected. So I knew that it would take more effort on my part. However, job placement is absolutely crucial for any startup bootcamp, and Ironhack is expanding in to Miami. To succeed in the more competitive bootcamp market in the US, you need to cultivate relationships with companies that are specifically interested and willing to hire bootcamp students.My expectation was that they would reach out to companies and pitch Ironhack and their students– in other words be proactive. What actually happened was they checked my spreadsheet and if they knew someone there they put me in contact. Which is helpful and I don't want to discount that, except 2/3 of those contacts were for companies were I had already gotten myself an employee referral and since their contact wasn't in a position to hire me they couldn't really provide me any assistance. In my opinion this just isn't aggressive enough because if they can't hit a high placement % then they are doing good enough.Ironhack's response is that they are working hard and this is what they told me I'd get, so if this meets your expectations you wil be fine. If not job placement is really important to you, you may want to look elsewhere.Tl;dr: Can be good depending on your needs. They can help you get jobs in Barcelona if you are eligible to work there, but if you want a lot of help for a non-EU job search they are limited to providing contacts to companies you've applied to. So far from my cohort the only person placed through Ironhack was hired by Ironhack.Summary:It was a fun experience overall, and I don't regret it. I did learn a lot despite the hiccups. However, I can't help but feel like they could have done much better and the communication was consistently a huge issue. I felt frustrated by the time wasted because of bad or unprepared instructors and bad internet. I felt like they missed a lot of important topics such as code reviewing and interview prep. And job assistance didn't meet my expectations at all. So yeah, YMMV. Living in Barcelona though, that I can recommend with no hesitation.Read Less",ironhack,10828

Read More to classes. HOW IT HELPED A bootcamp helps you to put your first step in to the world you are seeking to enter into, in this case the design world, which in Barcelona is very closed. While after university there is a huge gap between where you are and where you want to go, after Ironhack you actually have already contacts in where you want to go. In the bootcamp there will be events, people coming, lectures from interesting companies, but it will be up to you to network with them, nothing will come by itself. For example, after the hiring days 6 companies reached me and two weeks after I have offers for working for two of them. But it’s very up to you to have the initiative and search for the opportunities and also to decide which is a fair job deal. One month after I was hired in a big company with excellent wages and conditions, but still I feel it's rare. WHAT I LIKEDI went almost from zero in design. I had audiovisual background and it helped to improve some skills I  already had. But, I did build mostly everything from scratch. And now I feel like I increased 100% my skills. Immersive atmosphere it's all about design for 10 weeks. You will find yourself reading design articles while having breakfast and going to bed with design documentaries. ""Team feeling"". You spent a lot of time with the same persons every day. You better deal with it, make the most for getting along with them and encourage them to make things together. You will end the bootcamp with a groups of friends extremely motivate with design. WHAT I MISSEDGoing deeper in some parts of the curricula. More connection with lecturer's job during their classes. You are very free to do the tasks as good as you want. I missed more guidance when you feel demotivated in other to get better results for the portfolio. Not just getting task done because there are a deadlines.Read Less",ironhack,10828
2,258521,0,UX/UI Design,2019,0,,Full-time UX/UI Design Bootcamp,2.7,3.0,4.0,1.0,"I joined Ironhack UX/UI full-time design bootcamp after recommendation and many positive reviews I read on the Internet. It is important to notice here than Ironhack has many locations and for sure there is a lot of differences between them - actually... Read More it's hard to find them about this specific course in Berlin, so this is why I decided to write my opinion here.Maybe I will start from positive part here. The working environment it's really amazing, mostly due to the people who participate in the course. It's really great to work with people with different skills and with various background - everyone was very supportive, kind and helpful. When you are stuck with anything, you can always count on your classmates. Also, I think the curriculum is well constructed and contains the most important information - of course, it's super intense and it's not possible to remember everything from the lectures but you will get a forever access to the learning platform - pretty helpful. The cool building, comfortable chairs and the free barista were also big advantages :)Before joining the course, I studied carefully the info and details on their websites. For sure, Ironhack promises a lot and it's not suprising, beacuse the bootcamps are very expensive (and getting even more). I would like to refer here to some of their promises.First of all the, the group was bigger than they promised, and way bigger than in the different locations. I was counting for a small group and pair work experience, instead it was more like back-to-school and 4 people in the group way of working - way too much.First of all, the lead teacher is not a UX/UI designer, but a visual designer, and actually he is not even really interested in the UX part and as he admitted, he has never really worked with it. I expected him to have a broad knowledge about UX, but it was pretty limited to the slides he was presenting. Also, he was very hardly accessible - he was usually leaving early or were always busy with something else. To be honest, he didn't seem really interested in the job.Ironhack presents itself as a team ""tech spec"" - but a lot of times they are just lacking skills. The teacher and TA are definitely not specialist in the softwares that are used during the course - it's very disappointing. During the career week, some invited people to the school seemed pretty random - maybe just to fill our time with something? I'm not sure if inviting a person who is an ex-TA who doesn't have a job yet as an ""interview specialist"" or doing negotiation workshops with a person who has no experience with it is the best idea... I think Ironhack should really take closer look at the people who they are hiring - both the teacher and TAs seem often unmotivated and not really engaged in their work. I understand they are not professional designers but sometimes their advice and knowledge is lower that the participants of the course. And also, complaining about students in the common areas, where everyone can hear it, is VERY unprofessional.Overall, I learned a lot during the course, but it was a lot of my individual work I put in it and also from people I ask for advice from - unfortunately I can't say the staff was really helpful. I think that Ironhack is not a bad school, but for this price, people's expectations were way higher, what almost everyone admitted at the end. At the moment, I'd advice to think twice before joining campus in Berlin and maybe to consider different locations.Read Less",ironhack,10828

Read More out that the course teacher used to previously teach coding at a different academy. Because of this, we got zero intro on even the basics of UI, other than a vague introduction to color theory. There was only a passing mention of material design and design systems. Now I work as a UI UX designer, after 6 months of trying to find a job. I work solely on UI, which is what any entry level designer will be expected to do. During the course, we also focused on learning to code, which- sure was useful but did not need to be a priority in the short 2 month course. A lot of the coding teaching was done by the TA, who was quite a nice person but definitely not suited for teaching. Which bring me to how Ironhack also pumps up its employment percentage. It employs its students from previous courses as its TAs. This is unfair, I would hope that TAs would atleast have a 1year experience as a UI UX designer. Overall, its a fun environment and I made some great friends. In terms of learning, I did most of it myself after I graduated.

Another very disappointing fact is what they call the career week. They promised high quality preparation for the job interviews so you can nail them and get a job when you finish the bootcamp. Those lectures are nothing you can’t find or read online. They don’t have a good structure or unique method that they came up with, they even send you post I’ve already found before they sent them. Also you have the interviews with companies, what a mess and disappointment. They get companies they are not even looking for someone or they are looking to hire non-paid or low-paid interns and you have only 10 mins to talk to them inside of a caotic environment and people cutting you off. On top of that they even allow the teacher assistant to take part in the interviews which is unprofessional and really not fair for us...

The teaching team is really nice patient, approachable and friendly, and they won't hesitate to stay longer in the zoom to help you with projects/labs, which is really appreciated.Regarding their technical... Read More knowledge, sometimes I felt they lacked it when we asked questions in depth. Our cohort was about 15+ students and we only had one teacher and one TA, who graduated from Ironhack just a few months before, so his knowledge was quite limited, especially for the projects. This was inconvenient because several times we had to ""wait in line"" to get someone to help us debug our code (after we spent at least 30 min, if not more, without success). Also, it is super intense and I truly believe that 9 weeks is too short to really learn all that's offered in the curriculum and fully understand. Some topics are briefly discussed but they require a lot more of self-study after the bootcamp as in between sessions we're too busy with the evening labs (which take hours to solve, trust me).Keep in mind that in the full-time bootcamp, there's no day in between each class where you can see deeper some concepts. Every day is super challenging and we're moving onto new subjects quickly, so it's super important to keep your head out of the water and ask questions until you fully understand, otherwise you will miss a lot of knowledge.The technologies studied are overall good for the current job market except for Mongo DB (non-relational DB) which I wouldn't recommend because it's a and nowadays relational DB (like mySQL) are more in demand on job offers.Regarding the career week, to me, it sounded like a joke. From their marketing campaigns, it looks like they'll arrange for you interviews with companies they have an agreement with (based on their ""algorithm""), but in fact in that week, you basically learn how to make a CV and a cover letter, and they keep repeating to you that you should use your network and that they won't help you if you don't do your part of the job and complete all the tedious tasks on the student portal.One great thing was the ambiance with the other students and those from other cohorts. Especially during a very intense bootcamp where your brain is overwhelmed, it was nice, even remotely, to get to (virtually) meet up, play games, etc.Overall I don't regret the experience of a coding bootcamp because I learned a lot and that gave me a great push for a career in development, but don't fool yourself, you need to work a lot more and for many more months before you get a job in development unless you have coding experience prior to the bootcamp.A coding bootcamp is really not for everyone. If you're really determined to get a job right after, you better start working months before enrolling.Also, considering the price, I really think it's a rip-off (unless you get a substantial scholarship). The price for the on-site bootcamp and the remote one are almost the same which is not justifiable as by learning remotely, you don't use any location from Ironhack, you use your own desk, electricity, internet, etc, and even for the events, you're bringing your own beer! Honestly, there are plenty of other schools that offer similar curriculums for a much lower price (especially for the remote course). Ironhack doesn't offer anything really exceptional or differenc from other school on the market nowadays.Read Less",ironhack,10828

Read More and start my career. Reading the very good reviews here at Switchup, I decided to go for Ironhack. Unfortunately, I was naive. Ironhack has a really supporting and helpful community, and the learning by doing methodology resulted in a few case studies that I could showcase in my portfolio after graduating. However, there are a few things I want an aspiring attendee to have in mind. First of all: - Ironhack advertises themselves as having a '90% placement rate 180 days after graduation'. This is very misleading. The placement rate is calculated by dividing the number of employed students / number of students looking for a job. What they don't mention is that: out of all the graduates, only 68% are job searching. And their definition of 'employed' includes Hired-in-field, Hired-out-of-field (!), Ironhack Employee, Freelancer, Internships and Entrepreneurs. In reality, it's only 50% of UX/UI Design graduates who get a job within UX/UI Design after 6 months. I graduated several months ago and only a few people out of 20 in my cohort have managed to get a job at this point. Of course covid-19 complicates everything, but I have applied for 140+ jobs (resulting in around 10 interviews), studied theory and completed unpaid internships, and it seems quite hopeless at this point. I recommend reading their number in details here https://www.ironhack.com/en/news/ironhack-student-outcomes-report-audited-by-pwc - Another point that might be implicit when applying for a 10 week bootcamp is that the education is quite shallow. We never learned how to make safe assumptions out of research data. Instead, we angled the research to fit our design idea. This was due to lack of time and lack of knowledge since we never actually learned why we did things on a deeper level. We never got any feedback on our actual design process or design thinking, only on how we presented our design. I think this is a problem since we compete with people with more education and more experience within research and design thinking. - The education was very unstructured which became really stressful. We were already expected to put in 60-70 hours a week, but the teachers rarely managed to keep the time, resulting in a huge stress since we every week had to deliver a product design and a great presentation. ...

I also read a lot of reviews and saw very few negative ones, even ignoring them... Read More thinking that these were just exceptions, people who did not want to learn something new. But now I know they were people telling the truth. I don't want to offend anyone, I just see Ironhack as a service provider and I evaluate it as I see it. So let's begin! 1. The Teacher – Ignacio Soretas He can't speak English properly! He has a hard time understanding what we said, of course, I understand that English is not his mother language, but this is not just about pronunciation, it’s about the word combination he uses. He just lacks the ability to explain, to express himself correctly. Also, if you ask him a question, either verbal or written, he cannot understand what you are asking him, he cannot answer the question. It happened very often we asked him the same question in 1283091238901 different ways, just to understand what we are asking him and he again either says that he does not understand the questions or starts talking nonsense. Things that have nothing to do with the question. Example: Question: Hey Ignacio, how to clean this data? Answer: It’s very important to clean your data. OR I don't understand what you're asking ################################################################################################# It flows from topic to topic. Very often while talking about one topic he turns to another or goes back explaining some things he forgot to say, but we talked about them 2 hours ago and now he remembered to say them. Let me give you a similar example that will help us understand what I mean. Let's imagine that we have a task to cook a pizza. I guess most of the people reading this post know how to cook pizza and that's why I chose this example. Here's how Ignacio Soretas would explain how to cook a pizza. Example: Once you bought the dough from the store now roll it out and start making a pizza, then Michael Jackson was a very famous singer of the time, I forgot to tell you that he had no children, take the pizza out of the oven and eat. This was an example that contained words and objects that are close to our daily lives. It was easy to detect the catch, but now imagine he is talking about stuff you hear for the first time like data analysis, statistics etc... It’s impossible to understand what he means, but he left you with confusion with many questions. ################################################################################################# 2. Curriculum The simplest and most basic things we all need to know we’re not explained. Things like how to create a table (Data Frame) in Pandas (Python library used to operate with data). How to fill this table with information. How to change the values in the table and other basic stuff. The biggest downside is that they didn't teach us to THINK like a data analyst, they didn't teach us how to ask questions and how to check them, through the data, how to clean data, and many many more. ################################################################################################# Also, the exercises we had to do were not well structured and are not suitable for beginners. Task descriptions are very bad, it is difficult to understand what they want from us even for a person who is a native English speaker. Very often the exercises included tasks that were not adequate for everyday life. Things that have nothing to do with us. Difficult to assimilate and thus further complicate the understanding of the task. For example, things like some Pokemons and similar cartoon characters. We had the task to process a table with the characteristics of Pokemon and draw conclusions about them. Like ‘Who is the strongest Pokemon?’. As you can guess for people who have never seen this cartoon and have no idea about Pokemon, the difficulty of the task increases. Once because you do not understand what information the table contains and second because you do not understand how the code work, with which you are trying to process the table. It would be much better if the exercises contained things that are much closer to the problems in real life, things that we encounter every day, such as tables with information about food and so on. ################################################################################################# The lectures were nothing more than reading aloud, and there was nothing of added value. Not to mention that there were days when the lectures lasted about 4-5 hours from 9 to 14:00 in the afternoon and after such a long listening nothing remains in your head. The information should be conveyed in small steps and at small intervals, not a lot of information together. ################################################################################################# Often they said to us that if we had questions we should ask Google or our teammates and if we failed then we would ask for help from the assistant or the teacher. Well, this brings us automatically to the question if I have to ask my classmates or Google then why did I pay you more than 7K euros? ################################################################################################# SQL is the number 1 required skill to find a job as a data analyst, well we learn it only for one week… but spend 3 weeks in ML doing something that nobody understands, and nobody will hire us to make a model that we don’t understand how they work. Tableau is the number 2 required skill to find a job as a data analyst but we learn it only one day! ONLY ONE DAY, yes you read right ONLY ONE DAY! ################################################################################################# 3. Job support is even worst. I will tell you only that few months later I can’t find a job in the analytics field, and I will end there, hopefully, I helped you to understand what are the hidden costs of taking a Bootcamp at Ironhack. ################################################################################################# Of course, there are many more bullshits around them but yea, that’s enough for now. As a summary! STAY AWAY from IRONHACK! STAY AWAY from IRONHACK! Go to Udemy, Coursera, etc… and remember Data Analytics isn’t a sprint it’s a lifelong journey!Read Less",ironhack,10828

Read More country I was in and they have no idea about the market. The quality of study is very fast, it's not because it's a bootcamp, I did two and at Ironhack they save a lot on teachers, they would need at least 3 TA's and they have 1. The reviews on GitHub are fast, you can apply to jobs with a horrible GitHub and not know it, you leave without knowing how to make a good GitHub. Personally I complained and they ignored me and now that I have a job they write to me to use me as an example and publicity, many people who come out as an example of success in Ironhack did not get help from Ironhack. It is very expensive for what they offer. The career week is about making your CV and very basic things, we didn't improve our GitHub, there was no networking and they didn't help us at all to make a portfolio, I don't recommend it.Read Less",ironhack,10828

I've been contacted with someone named Ariana Quintana to have a meeting and assist me in my application. The application began smothly... Read More but slowly turned down hell when I started asking about the course and curriculum. She was very rude and said why are you asking about Tabloue? didn't you read our Syllabus? if you are interested stuyding Tablou you shouldn't have contacted us because we don't teach it. I told her but is in the Syllabus ! and questioning my intelgiance by not reading the Syllabus. eventually she saw Tablou written in the Syllabus and said I don't know why it's there but we don't teach it. At the end I had enough with this employee and her attitude and told her I am no longer interested in attending your school ! she said well we don't want people like you too. Then asked her please to no longer send me the assisment test and hanged the meeting. I urge people in charge of Ironhack to rreevaluate this employee and give her some classes on how to talk to people and if the meeting was recored please check the way she talk to see it yourself.

We were supposed to have a classroom assistant and never did. We were supposed to present our final projects to local companies and never did. We were supposed to interview with local companies and that never happened. Overall it was not worth the 10k. I hoped after graduating they would help us get interviews but even after I did everything they requested I was only given 2 interviews and they were both paying $0 internships. I was trying to change careers leaving a well-paying job. I could only ever recommend this Bootcamp if you're just graduating High School and have no plans to ever go to College. Definitely do not expect any actual job opportunities or assistance after the program they will just recommend you to go to job fairs. Out of 10 people in my class, only 2 landed jobs that were on their own. One had connections from before the course and the other already had a Degree in Engineering... the rest went back to previous employment outside of Tech. DO NOT waste your money and time... if you are serious about breaking into tech take the free courses online and build projects. That is what they will tell you anyway after you graduate.Read Less",ironhack,10828

The 9 weeks are just to get started with the basics. There are bootcamps that teach for over 20-30 weeks with the same price but the knowledge gained it far better. Do not fall into the trap that people land jobs after Ironhack like I said. Those that get a job all had some previous coding experience or the company was just a small one. The career hack was full of so many promises but lacked a lot. The career coaches have no clue on how a tech interview takes place nor have they ever applied to any tech job. My 2 cents from the entire experience would be save your money and do some Udemy courses. They are same. Ironhack boasts about it's network, but you're free to go for their meetup and events, or better go for in general tech events in your city. They are far more productive and rewarding.Read Less",ironhack,10828
