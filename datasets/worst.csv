3,231555,1,,2018.0,1,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,,"App academy is no joke. You will spend every single day, night and day for the next 9 weeks reading new material, watching videos, doing homework and debugging, all the while drinking endless cups of coffee. You are required to check in 3 times a day... Read More (9AM, 1:30PM, and 4:00PM) or you will get a strike. 10 strikes and you're out. Overall, you will learn Ruby, SQL, Rails, JavaScript, React, and Redux. You won't get much practice on HTML/CSS, until you get to your full stacks in week 8, where you put everything together to clone a website. For the first 7 weeks, the daily routine is basically HTML/CSS in the morning, lecture until about lunch time, then pair programming the rest of the day. The last 30 minutes are spent with your ""circle"" discussing your day. The evenings are spent on reading and watching videos on tomorrow's material and usually accompanied with basic exercises. The readings and videos will take a decent chunk of your time, so I suggest doing them ahead of time if you can. There are 6 assessments throughout the course. They tell you almost exactly what is going to be on the assessment, they give you a practice assessment, they give you a test generator to time yourself, they give you a video of a TA going through the practice assessment. Basically you shouldn't feel lost when studying up for the assessment. All the resources are there for you. When full stacks arrive on week 8, things change. No more lectures, no more circle time, and no more readings and videos. You work on your full stack all day, helping each other out when you hit bugs, giving tips to others who are doing the same or similar websites.Some constructive criticism. The lectures, especially toward the end of the curriculum, were particularly long, and most of it was very similar to our homework that we already completed the previous night. I honestly only found those lectures useful for asking questions, but I did not feel the need to spend 2-3 more hours on the same topic we already spent hours learning for homework. The instructions for the daily projects are outstanding, providing step-by-step instructions on what you need to do next and why, that is up until around the end of week 6. Often times there will be a bulleted-list of directions telling you to implement so-and-so, when before these bulleted-list of directions would each have their own paragraph, supplemented with code snippets and explanations. In the React projects especially, they would tell you to implement something, and a few lines later, they'd provide the exact code you should write. I don't think that is helpful to our understanding. Some TAs are older and more experienced, others are recent graduates of App Academy themselves. Some are clearly better at explaining, while some kind of just look at the solutions and tell you to write what the solutions did. I'm thankful they are all trying and willing to help, but I'd always hope for certain TAs over others when hitting that ""Ask a question"" button.All in all, it was a very rewarding experience. I've met and made many new friends. Knowing that everyone else in your cohort is going through the exact same thing is reassuring, that everyone else is sleep-deprived and feeling exhausted all the time, that if you ran into a bug that someone else will most likely have also ran into the same bug, that you have others who also committed the next 9 weeks to change their life. I've learned more at App Academy and produced more projects that I am proud of than I did in 4 years in college as a Computer Science major. If you are thinking about attending App Academy, I'd definitely recommend it. Be prepared to make some great friends, and also be prepared for some feels when your new friends drop out.

Only three years ago, I was a philosophy major at Vassar College. While I was a tech-enthusiast, I always believed that my non-coding background limited my ability... Read More to enter this field once I graduated. However, by sheer luck, I stumbled upon Springboard's online UX course and signed up. At the time, I hardly had any little knowledge of what UX was at all. Now, as a UX Designer at IBM, I cannot stress how pivotal this course in enabling me to jumpstart my career.Springboard uses an intuitive website to guide students through the various stages of designing a mobile application or website (which may conveniently enough be used as a portfolio piece). Utilizing a mixture of articles, interactive courses, and videos, I was able to gain a firm understanding of the different design research methodologies popular in the field. This was important on two fronts. Firstly, these techniques helped me design better applications, since tools like card sorts, interviews, and wireframings genuinely help you design better experiences and can be applied virtually anywhere. Secondly, the techniques I learnt served as buzzwords to those I interviewed with for UX Design roles that demonstrated my knowledge in the field.On top of this, there were two aspects that made this course truly successful. The first was the weekly Skype calls with a design mentor. At the start of the course, I was assigned a mentor who was a professional in the field. Once a week I could consult her with any questions about the coursework, or any career-related questions I had. Cultivating this relationship humanized the course for me, and transformed it from a collection of videos and literature to a full-fledged course. The second aspects that stood out to me was the price. At 400 dollars a month, you really can't complain given the material you're given. I was able to go on to develop 4 portfolio pieces with other clients after the course to build my name- other popular alternatives such as General Assembly will run you thousands of dollars more.Overall, would definitely recommend this course!Read Less",springboard,11035

Read More very experienced programmers teaching, etc. I'll focus comments on what I differs from the norm in AA. Most of these differences are observed second-hand, through interviewing candidates from other bootcamps for the place I work now.ProsAA spends time developing algorithmic thinking. We started off barely knowing enough Ruby to run nested for loops to solve 'Fizz Buzz'. In the next 5 days we implemented a lot of things like binary search and quick sort. At the end of the first week, we built Tic Tac Toe allowing human players to play through the terminal against an unbeatable AI in 8 hours (that was nuts!). A few weeks later we took 5 days to learn all the same things in Javascript. Many of the junior programmers I've interviewed from other camps knew a lot of ways to do things with Rails, but didn't know how to script well enough in plain old Ruby/JS.AA taught object-oriented and social programming. Our code was constantly evaluated for object-oriented thinking, clarity in choice of variable and function names, and accessibility to other programmers. Really handy now when I'm working with 6 other engineers!AA taught away the magic. AA's instructors taught this super well - nothing is magical. In the course we did things like rebuild Active Record through meta programming, recreate the basics of Backbone.js using plain Javascript, implement our own sessions/login before using Devise/Sorcery, read server logs to detect and get rid of N+1 queries, and other things that dig deeper into frameworks that many take for granted.They know what companies are looking for. I was fortunate enough to get 5 offers in 4 weeks of searching after AA. They really prepared me for the job search.ConsAA's curriculum covers less overall material. I think the course was a little too light on coverage of CSS. We also didn't cover some classic Rails patterns, like making forms work through AJAX with Rails' forms using remote: true ( we did cover how to AJAXify through plain old JS, obviously). Finally, I wish we had spent more time learning to code through TDD. It's a tradeoff for focusing more deeply.AA is extremely fast-paced. You have to work hard to keep up. Definitely reminded me of 'drinking from the firehose' in my MIT days. Your brain will hurt a lot. You will stress over keeping up and doing the homework after coding for 10 hours straight.

Despite coming from a background completely unrelated to computer science or design, and starting from basically zero, I finished the course with a great portfolio piece and a solid proficiency in programs like Sketch and InVision, which are industry standard tools used in today's companies. The class was small (around 8 people) so you really get an intimate learning experience and lots of one-to-one time with the instructor, who was incredibly insightful and supportive. She makes an effort to touch base with all her students during each class and takes the time to help us through Slack if we ever need her outside of class. Each week's lesson is packed with information, but what I found most useful were the industry relevant anecdotes that Kelsey, our instructor, gave during her lessons. We learned about visual design, wireframing, and prototyping. The entire program is designed around the final project, which is something you start working on from Week 2.

Read More and TheOdinProject prior but it was hard to keep myself accountable. Due to the massive amounts of tutorials and references available through open source, I found it hard to make serious progress as I would jump from language to language, not sure of what I should learn with the limited time that I had. AppAcademy provided me structure and forced me to be disciplined and I was able to make massive progress in 3 months, much more than I ever did when I was self-studying and not fully immersing myself.I would say that most of the knowledge is picked up through pair programming. Having to work with another partner daily during the curriculum really sharpened my understanding of not only the material but my ability to articulate it to other people. You'll also learn a lot when you help your cohort mates debug and vice versa. The curriculum is very fast-paced and it is amazing how fast you feel that you can fall behind in only a day. The React/Redux portion was probably the most challenging week in the curriculum as new material is just piled onto you.Our cohort is currently in the job search curriculum so I cannot comment at the moment regarding the job search. Needless to say, I am looking forward to opening up this new chapter in my career.To answer some questions that I had when I was making the decision to enroll:- The language you learn doesn't matter. Once you are familiar with how web-development works, you realize that there are similar patterns/conventions that are fundamental to each language. Different programming languages can all achieve the same means.- Make sure you enroll ahead of the months notice that they tell you to. You do have pre-curriculum prep that you have to do before the cohort that requires at least two weeks of time. I personally went through the prep work twice before my cohort started as well as learning as much JavaScript as I could. This goes a long way between determining how stressed you feel during the lecture part of the curriculum when you're learning new materials everyday.- I did a good amount of problems on CodeWars and CodeFights and LeetCode during my preparation for the application. While it helped me learn how to problem solve, web development is actually a totally different beast!

And then you grow up to realize they're pretty much winging it? Elements of App Academy feel a bit like that.To be clear, I really enjoyed App Academy... Read More and thought it was about as good as one could do trying to teach this amount of material in a very condensed period of time. But I don't think aA should remain complacent because there is definitely room for improvement. For instance, when you first arrive, you learn a bit about the TAs, some of whom may have just graduated from aA the week before. This isn't inherently a bad thing, but you do see a big disparity between TAs who have more experience and those that are hot off the presses for lack of a better term. This becomes more obvious the more you ask about topics that are tangentially related to the curriculum. I think the TAs on average tend to nail topics related to every day's projects, but if you're looking for a resource to widen your understanding of some technologies you may find yourself slightly disappointed depending on who you ask. The next element I took issue with is the check-in structure. I want to emphasize this: bootcamp students are adult humans. App Academy has a thrice daily check-in (by 9, 1:10-1:130, 3:55-4:00) that must be done on their internet to confirm that you're there. On one hand--I get it because we do pair programming for most of the day and missing out on the pairing screws over your partner for the day. On the other hand, we don't need to be treated like elementary school students and should be given at least a LITTLE more license over our education. This isn't likely to change anytime soon, so if it seems overbearing to you, keep that in mind.Assessments. The assessments are necessary but flawed... one one hand, you need to make sure students are really keeping up with their understanding of the material because if you don't understand each week or day's subject matter, you're setting yourself up for failure in the coming weeks. That said, the assessments aren't so dynamic that you can't just read the specs, learn the patterns, and pass the assessments without fundamentally understanding the core concepts. All this is to say that students that don't have a great understanding of the material can sneak through the system by memorizing patterns needed for assessments. I think they could stand to be recalibrated.The curriculum is excellent but the project instructions vary pretty drastically from day to day. Some days the projects feel clear as day and the instructions step through the material in a way that puts you and your partner in the driver's seat giving you the appropriate amount of hints/code. Other days the instructions feel really really open ended and make far too many assumptions about our prior knowledge. I could continue to nitpick details about App Academy, but at the end of the day, the students are bright, motivated, and the environment is extremely positive and supportive. While the work load at times can feel overwhelming, the TAs and your fellow students are always there to help. I would recommend App Academy to just about anybody looking to quickly get from 0 to 100 as a web developer and I would encourage aA to never stop improving.Read Less",app-academy,10525

After having finished this course, I can honestly say that I have achieved these goals and so much more. I learned more from the 10 weeks I had spent attending this course than I did from months of self-teaching. I attribute this success to Jonathan, the lead instructor and the two teach assistants Nic and Anthony. Jonathan is an incredibly motivating and inspiring educator that brings out the best in his students. His enthusiasm for web development and technology makes learning from him so easy. The material Jonathan decided to include in the curriculum was well thought out as we covered technologies that are the most recent and relevant in the tech industry. I feel that this has given us a competitive advantage in the job market. Along with his remarkable teaching ability, Jonathan fostered an environment where we as a class were given many opportunities to learn with each other, as well as pursue our own passions. Through this, I have learned and became friends with some incredible individuals. I also learned more about the joys of being a developer and what ultimately drives me creatively. These outcomes are invaluable. Finally, Jonathan and the teaching assistants, Nic and Anthony were invested and committed to the students' success throughout the entire program. They have always been approachable and offered support and motivation when any of us were going through difficult times. This meant a lot to us. There were many times in the past 10 weeks where they would stay in during lunch time to help students or answer our questions after hours and during the weekends. While they always were willing to lend a hand, they would never explicitly tell us the answers to our questions because that is not the most optimal way to learn. They know that being a successful web developer entails being able to critically think and problem solve as we will not be spoon fed while working in the field. Overall, BrainStation's Full-Time Full Stack Web Development program blew me away. I have become a much better programmer and I have created meaningful friendships along the way. I would recommend this course to anyone that wants to improve their skills as a developer, whether they are new or experienced. This program is much about what you put into it. This program is not for people who are selfish, close-minded and/or expect to have their hand held.

For me, I wanted a career change and knew that web development was the path I wanted to pursue, and was lucky enough to be put in a cohort with 13 others, each with very diverse backgrounds and intentions. The course is designed to equip individuals with the relevant skills required to start a career as a junior web developer, which means to train your brain to function as a programmer, to be comfortable finding answers when in doubt instead of asking and getting what you want all the time - as technology is always changing and programmers need to be resourceful rather than being spoon fed. I quickly realized that I wasn't picking up the course content as quickly as I wanted to and was fortunate enough to have Jonathan Bluks as our lead instructor along with two of his TA's who facilitated the course content very well. They always provided just enough help to answer the core question, while giving enough leeway for my own personal growth, and I know for a fact that they feel more proud of students than the students themselves whenever anyone of us have a eureka moment (the hi5's are real, hard, and very genuine). The course content is also very relevant to what the industry is looking for, I found that to be especially true now that I'm applying for jobs myself, and it's great to see that whatever BrainStation taught has led to some pretty decent conversations with programmers and recruiters alike. Even if they require another technology package, it's still very easy to pick up with knowledge of with what was being taught in class.In addition, weekly assignments and a mid-course hackathon, along with a final individual project to showcase your personality and coding skills, provide enough starter projects and more importantly the skills required to be able to reflect on how you'll want to shape your career or build a web-app from scratch. Overall, as a graduate, my advise would be to think through your purpose of taking the course, make sure BrainStation is aware of your goals, always be humble and willing to learn instead of being prideful and resistant to change. Learning can be fun with your classmates as we all struggle together and are willing to voice out our problems to learn from each other. It was amazing how, at week 7/8 of 10, everyone thought to themselves somehow ""Hey, I don't think I'm really good, but somehow I feel that I could actually do this and I know where to look for resources"" and remembering how at the start we were all staring blankly at our screens not knowing how to start.Definitely recommend BrainStation to anyone looking for a full-time Web Development Bootcamp, their continued 12-week career guidance program shows that they're willing to go above and beyond to help land you a job after the course.

I have been proven wrong during the course, as it is definitely not a breeze to get through, it's tough and definitely requires external resource hunting (as it should), but I feel like the knowledge that I am getting is well worth the challenge! I love the space, feel that the instructors are extremely knowledgable, love the visual appeal of using Xcode, and am excited to tackle learning Swift!Aside from the course, the BrainStation atmosphere and culture is great.

I was initially won over by App Academy’s deferred tuition model because it aligned... Read More the school’s interests of getting paid with my interests of getting a coding job post-bootcamp.But the tuition model only works because App Academy actually delivers on their ambitious sales pitch. As a former high school math teacher, I was most impressed by App Academy’s curriculum and instruction. As someone who was definitely on the less experienced end of the spectrum (I had worked in an operations role at a tech startup prior, but never as a developer), App Academy continuously pushed me just outside of my intellectual comfort zone for 12 weeks straight. What’s more, App Academy’s flipped classroom approach, emphasis on building projects and pair programming ensured that I was really internalizing and absorbing the enormous amount of material. The weekly assessments were definitely stressful to say the least, but looking back, I’m thankful because I know the material that much better. In addition, NYC staff members are not only super knowledgeable and passionate about technology themselves, but they’re also genuinely nice people who really put student learning first and foremost (regardless of how novice the question). The real game-changer is your fellow students: these are some of the smartest people I’ve ever collaborated with, and we really supported each other throughout to understand the material.I’m not going to lie and say that it was a breeze — it was probably the hardest three-months of work.

After four years in a field that was not everything I expected it to be, I decided that I wanted to make a change; and I assume... Read More since you are reading this review, you are thinking the same thing. Once I decided that I was invested in making this transition, and a bootcamp was the best way for me to make the change, I began to compare various programs and the main thing that differed App Academy from the others was their payment plan. Due to the time requirements for all these programs (80+ hours a week) it is pretty unrealistic to expect to keep any resemblance of a job/income and living in NYC without one is pretty tough to do. App Academy helps remedy this by not requiring any payment (other than a security deposit) until you land that first job. Not only did this make living in an expensive city with no job more do-able but also gives them a ""horse in the race” when you start your job hunt. This includes continuous interview prep of white boarding, alumni Q&amp;A, review/critique of your portfolio (resume, cover letter, GitHub/coding projects, personal website, and LinkedIn profile) as well as an in-house job fair at the end of your cohort.Regarding the curriculum I found that while interviewing, most companies are not looking for you to know a certain stack but have the ability to learn a new stack (if needed) based on what you already know. Most bootcamps offer a full stack curriculum in order to give you the needed marketable skills to prove you confidently know what you should and that you can learn something new if needed, and App Academy is no different. When I attended, the stack was Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL, Javascript, Backbone.js, jQuery, HTML, and CSS and since then they have updated to React.js instead of Backbone.js, but don’t worry, all new material is available to you as alumni so that you can use it if you would like to learn a new framework. Like anything you do, you will get what you put in and App Academy gives you everything you need in order to succeed and become qualified in all the topics you cover. From day one you will need to properly prepare for the interview process where you will complete online exams, a live coding challenge, and a live interview; and the testing doesn't end there. To make sure that everyone is where they need to be so that no student is disadvantaged while pair programming there are (bi)-weekly exams that you must pass in order to continue with the program. Preparing for this will include hours of studying and practice on the weekends and after class… this will definitely be 80+ hours a week. All of this is not to discourage you because if you really expect to become proficient in so many languages in such a short amount of time, this is the only way to do it. If you are ready to put in the time for 4 months and 100% sold on becoming a developer I think that App Academy will be perfect for you.TL:DR - App Academy offers a comparable stack/curriculum to other bootcamps with everything you need to succeed if you are really 100% committed to the program. It WILL be 80+ hours a week to get by and pass their weekly progress exams and 100+ if you want to really excel at everything. That being said, I would not be at my current company without it and the payment plan they offer allowed me to even think this transition would be possible.Read Less",app-academy,10525

Fred is as efficient as a programming instructor can be. He takes the time to answer all our questions, but, at the same time, makes sure we go through each lecture fast enough so that we have time to work on the assignments ourselves. While we're working on our assignments, he comes around and checks on our progress, and helps those who are struggling or have questions. Bootcamp prep classes are 2 hours a day, Monday to Friday for a month. That means that you can do it while working. I wasn't, but several of my classmates, at the time, were. You should be aware, however, that to do well in it, you're going to need to dedicate another hour or two to it. I spent an average of 4-5 hours a day on it, completing assignments and reading the lecture notes beforehand.Other things that might be of particular interest: (1) You're free to use either Windows, OSX, or Linux. (I used Windows.) However, FYI most coding bootcamps require a Mac for their full stack web development courses. (2) You might be wondering, why does the prep course teach JavaScript? That's because most bootcamps let (or require) you to interview in JavaScript. (3) The course has an online discussion forum, set up via a website called Piazza. Since the course itself runs in parallel with the bootcamp prep courses in other areas, you can ask for help from other bootcamp prep instructors and students from across the nation. (The course was only set up in SF and NY when I took it, but it now seems like more locations have opened.) (4) If you're taking this course to get into App Academy's full stack web development course, you get to skip the pre-challenge and move straight to a 45-min technical interview.Overall, the bootcamp prep course is a big investment, but it will increase your chances of getting in a top bootcamp. I worked through the practice exercises for the technical interview for App Academy's full stack web development course, and I believe that I was able to solve all of them due to the fact that I had acquired the logical thinking required through constant coding at Bootcamp Prep.

The details of the course can be found on their website so I won't go into that here. The reason I say this course is all about you is because you have one month to get into the bootcamp of your dreams, put your all into it. If you're looking for a bootcamp prep course, I am assuming you already am ready to commit some 3 months of your life to flip it upside down. The same idea applies to this course, you have 1 month to make those 3 months a reality. Those 3 months bootcamps that you dreamt of, you can have your pick of the litter and make it your reality.

This does not mean you need to drop everything just yet. The course I took was part time accessible for a reason. The curriculum covered everything I was being tested on and more. As long as you grasp concepts and can write code accordingly, you will be in great shape. I assume the tests will only get harder as the years go by but I know App Academy is an adaptive school and I wouldn't be surprised if they adapt their curriculum as the times change. The ""Job Support"" is what I consider to be their application support. Coming out of this prep course you apply to bootcamps, not jobs, but I consider this to be the equivalent. It was good. There were extra materials to work on and mock interviews to be scheduled.I can't vouch for any other bootcamp prep courses. Even if the curriculum is the same, the experience could be completely different. I went to App Academy's Bootcamp Prep Course and I hit the jackpot. Things click for me. I'm not a wiz, remember I failed after the second basic coding challenge, never mind the technical interview, but after the course I killed it all.I'm confident that this course can do a lot for a lot of other people.

I now work at an awesome company working on really cool problems as a full stack engineer.My background: I had taken a... Read More couple of college C.S. classes and I had a degree in analytic philosophy. I'd done codeacademy and tried a couple small projects, but I was having trouble making the leap to employment-level skills.The structure and content of the App Acadaemy curriculum is top notch. They know exactly what is useful and what is not. For example - not useful: rote memorization of code. Useful: learning how to think logically, approach problems with the intention of creating an elegant algorithm, and how to read documentation and quickly pick up new skills. That being said, the tools you learn are also really useful tools to know how to use: they focus on ruby/rails, sql/active record, and javascript/react (when I took the course, it was backbone).The quality of instruction is incredibly high, and you spend most of your time (probably 80% of the day) actually coding and working on problems. I really liked that, as I definitely learn better by doing, and most of the best learning moments were working with TA's who could explain a concept in practice after getting stuck on a specific part of a problem.After the course, they have good resources to help you apply and interview for positions. It's still a lot of work, but it's really valuable to hear what actually matters on a resume or cover letter, what interviewers are actually looking for, etc.I now work at a really cool company, working on stuff way more interesting than anywhere else I've ever worked, and getting paid like 3x more than I was at my old job. I'm using the ruby/rails and js I learned at App Academy, but I'm also using React on the front end, as well as Scala/C++ on the backend. So don't let anyone tell you that you're only qualified in the language you know.Two quick caveats: 1) This is not a place for people who want to figure out if they'll enjoy software engineering. You have to be committed and ready to work really hard from the beginning. 2) This is not a place for people who have trouble self-motivating. 80-90 hours per week is not a joke, and a lot of that is forcing yourself to work through really complicated readings and problems. After graduating, you won't be handed a job, but you'll have the skills to get a great job if you work hard and keep practicing. But if you're likely to burn out easily or need someone else to push, maybe this isn't the best place for you.tl;dr:Great program that will teach you the skills and mindset to be a software engineer anywhere if you're already motivated and willing to work for it.Read Less",app-academy,10525

I had picked up programming as a hobby and found that I really enjoyed it, but I had no idea how to turn it into a job. Around that time, programming ""bootcamps"" entered... Read More my radar, seemingly presenting a viable means to make the switch. After some research, I decided a/A was the one for me, largely due to the pricing structure and an excellent review from a friend of a friend that had recently attended. Let me go off on a tangent here and rave about the pricing structure. If you're not aware, App Academy charges nothing up front (although there is a deposit). You don't pay anything until you get a job and then once you do get a job, you pay a percentage of your salary. This unique model is incredibly fair, allows someone like myself who couldn't afford other bootcamps to attend, and says a lot about what a/A offers. With this model, a/A would completely fail if what they were offering was anything less than high quality.The application process was very challenging and took a bit longer than I expected. The process includes interviews and several coding challenges but you are not penalized for the time it takes to get through it all. a/A even provides a whole bunch of rich materials that, with enough review and practice, should be sufficient enough for one to get through the challenges. This says a lot about a/A's integrity and accessibility. a/A has high acceptance standards, but if you are willing to put in the work there's a good chance you'll get in, and a/A wants to help you be successful in doing so. In fact, I didn't pass the last coding challenge, but since I was close to a solution I was given more material to go through and a second chance.a/A kicked off at full speed. I was expecting the program to be challenging and a whole lot of work, and I experienced exactly that. Days typically consisted of a ""lecture"" in the early morning led by the instructors where we went over the previous days assignments, went through demos, had a Q&amp;A etc. Then we jumped into the days assignments which would take up most of the rest of the afternoon and often the evening. Most days we pair programmed, which was much more fun (and less lonely) than my programming journey had been up until this point. Seeing others' approaches to problems was also very insightful. At night we were expected to go over the solutions to the days problems and do the reading for the following day. We had nearly weekly programming assessments that were often very difficult, primarily due to not being able to use any resources. I hated the assessments due to the stress they brought me, but they did force us to develop a deep understanding of key concepts. However, even with regular stresses and working upwards of 100 hours a week, my time at a/A was very enjoyable. The instructors were incredible resources (I wish I took more advantage of this) and I made a ton of great friends. I have no shortage of fond memories from this period of my life and I was pretty bummed to see it end.I can't recommend App Academy enough. I had a great time, the program is of the highest quality, and I couldn't be happier with the results I got. 3 months at App Academy (plus a few months in preparation) got me into a career that I'm very happy to be in and my income has doubled. How can you beat that? Also, 6 months after completion my debt to a/A was completely fulfilled. I graduated from college six years ago and I don't even want to get into how much of that student debt remains. If you're seriously interested in programming as a profession, make a/A your first consideration.Read Less",app-academy,10525

My cohort was exceptional -- I had less programming experience than many of my peers, but the curriculum moves so fast that students of all backgrounds were constantly challenged and engaged. Sometimes the speed and quantity of assessments felt overwhelming, but it is necessary if you want to learn something as complex as the fundamentals of web development in such a short period of time. I'm sure everyone reading this has looked at app academy's website and read other reviews, so I won't get into the hiring stats, salaries, etc., other than to say that my cohort's experience with the job hunt certainly lived up to all of the advertising. Instead, I want to focus on something that I didn't expect before joining app academy, and that is the culture of instruction. App Academy promotes itself as a rigorous program with great stats, but doesn't necessarily advertise culture, and this made me nervous going into the program (I really liked some other bootcamps' focus on culture). I was extremely happily surprised when I joined app academy -- even if the focus on promoting a positive culture isn't part of the brand, the instructors at app academy did an incredible job fostering positive conversation, promoting inclusiveness during a stressful period, and I can see that they've continued to hire some of the brightest and most empathetic communicators from succeeding cohorts. This was hugely important, but many of the reviews that I read before joining app academy just focused on the challenge and the job hunt.

If you can graduate from a/A, you can get a job in development (and succeed in it!)The cons: This course is not a fun time. App Academy is grueling and, frankly, pretty miserable most of the time. If doing all code every day sounds like a negative, this might not be the course for you. If you aren't excited enough about code to put your life on hold for 12 weeks, you should probably look for a different bootcamp.

I did a lot of research and applied to many of the major boot camps offering 'similar' curriculums. I was accepted to a few including Dev Bootcamp and Flatiron School. All of the boot camps say that their curriculum is geared towards people with ""no experience"", so anyone can do it. That's a bit misleading as they all will expect you to demonstrate some logical competency and a basic understanding of how to problem solve programmatically in the interview. I spent about 6 months practicing on sites like codeschool.com and codewars.com before I began applying. In the end, I selected a/A for two reasons: their tuition structure (pay after you get a job), and because I found their application process to be the most difficult. I applied 3 times before I was accepted to a/A, vs. my first try at the other schools.During:My brother is a Marine and had a great time ribbing me about going to a 'boot camp' for obvious reasons. But I have to say, although there are not pushups, calling it a boot camp isn't far off. It is very, very hard, and the hours are long. Again, I never graduated college, so my basis for comparison might be skewed, but even people in my cohort with degrees ranging from BAs to PhDs acknowledged that it was a difficult program. The style of teaching at a/A is to show you a thing once, then give you instructions and a day to replicate it with a partner, with the TAs on hand to assist. They will not give you direct answers (for the most part) but rather guide you through the all-important process of debugging and figuring out problems on your own. It's challenging, and at times very frustrating, but ultimately the system teaches you how to be a self-reliant developer.After:In 5 months I went from being a bartender with no college degree to a well-paid full-stack (actual job title, not just a buzz word) web developer at a company that I'm very excited about. Most graduates (so far, from my class) landed an initial salary between 90 and 100k. Another concern I had going in was that a/A teaches Ruby on Rails, which some developers will tell you isn't the most relevant language these days. That's BS. Developers love to be opinionated about the tech that they work with, and you will be too eventually. I love Rails, but I can say objectively that it's more about learning how a server is structured than the specific syntax you are using. The knowledge that I got from a/A felt tech agnostic by the time I reached the job hunt; language is a nonissue. Anyways, there are definitely a lot of Rails specific developer positions out there if that's the route you decide to go. The job hunt is a bit intense, but there are designated a/A staff members to help you along the way. If you follow their road map, keep studying after graduation, and utilize your peer support network, you will find a job in under 3 months.  Tl;drIt's hard to get in, very hard to keep up, and reasonably difficult to find a job afterward. But if you are expecting any part of it to be easy it's not for you.

Read More through as much of the day's material as possible. The curriculum is definitely grueling. The 70-90 hours of coding a week is a real thing and will leave you without almost anytime for anything else (social life, sometimes laundry, mealprepping). Even after doing 70-90 hours a week, you will have to learn to be okay with some concepts / ideas falling through the cracks as it is inevitable at the learning pace. Throughout the course I felt like I was barely keeping afloat during the material, as most everyone else was, as your TA's will tell you, this is normal. As we progressed through the course, I found myself understanding concepts later on through the week, and slowly found myself struggling with newer material at the tail end of the course. I started to feel not as strong as I did earlier on and worried that I would not be ready to tackle the fullstack project that is completed after the coding curriculum. That was completely not true, once we hit our projects I found out how much I learned and quickly was able to cover the knowledge gaps I did have beforehand just by working through the projects.

Cons:* Some teachers are fresh graduates of the program so in some cases they will have to defer to a more senior member. Not a big deal, just wastes a little time. * It is a lot of work. If you make it in and you are able to keep up (try not to fall more than a day behind), then you will learn a lot but you can't slack off. During the week I had zero free time, but on most weekends I had some free time. I would rather have it at this pace than be less work spread over more time. * Pressure. Since you can get kicked out for poor performance (not hard to do if you fall behind more than a couple days), there is quite a bit of stress and pressure involved. It eases up later in the program as the chances of getting kicked out diminish significantly.* Inconsistencies in curriculum. Since their curriculum is constantly evolving and being worked on by multiple people, some parts of it are out of date, some are redundant, and some are incorrect. Overall I give it 5 stars because I learned a lot, had fun, and got an amazing job!

The pace of the course was no joke. Students were expected to learn and be able to understand that day's material. Be prepared to quickly absorb the materials since the... Read More next day will be something completely new. I would advise anyone who is not able to keep up with this pace to reconsider applying to App Academy. However, if you love coding and have aspiration to become a software developer, App Academy's rigorous course should be your number one bootcamp options as they push you to your limit and allow you grow independently as a developer. A roadmap advice for fellow future developers applying to App Academy: one, study up. The bootcamp says they will accept students even if they have not never code before. However, the coding challenges to get accepted in the bootcamp are not trivial. They will require some basic knowledge of a programming language. App Academy also offers a free JumpStart program or a Bootcamp Prep course that will prepare you for these coding challenges. If you have never coded before, I highly advise doing either of the programs I mentioned before. They are extremely helpful and you also get a taste of the App Academy's culture before joining. Great! You passed the coding challenges and the non-technical interview and are accepted into App Academy. Now what? It is very important to do and complete the Alpha Course before the start of the curriculum. Ninja advice, the Alpha Course will prep you well for the first two weeks, but you have to keep learning at a fast pace. You will not be doing just Ruby (the first language taught in App Academy) . If you have extra time before starting App Academy, my advice is to read up and look at some code for SQL and Ruby on Rails. This will smooth your transition from simple object oriented programming in the first two weeks to the first real web development process, backend development and database management. You are about to make an exciting decision in your life. Prepare for 80 to 90 hours a week of hard work. You will be living and breathing code. You will have no life, but you will form close bonds with your cohort. Mostly important, you will be having fun because this is what you have always dreamed of doing, so go out there and apply!Read Less",app-academy,10525

The screening process was rigorous but humane, and they treat you like a valued individual (as opposed to another equivalent school that I got into... Read More where the interviewer was taking a Lyft or something while he was conducting my interview). The curriculum itself is really really well designed, not only building on itself to facilitate learning and deep comprehension, but is constantly being updated to incorporate the most highly demanded and up to date technologies. In my cohort they trained us to be strong React and ES6 developers, while not neglecting the older technologies, like jQuery. This turned out to be invaluable in the job hunt, since a lot of companies were looking for React developers when we graduated. I was skeptical at first about their emphasis of Ruby on Rails, since most companies seem to be moving away from that, but in retrospect, it really is the best way to learn about how a full stack application works, especially for people with less experience. And they do their best to give you a deep understanding of why things work the way they do so that those skills are transferrable. The program also gives you a good foundation in algorithms, web and backend architecture, and interviewing skills. I was just amazed at the amount of knowledge I had gained after the 13 week program. I received 5 job offers within 3 weeks of graduating, one of which I ended up accepting, and I'm very excited to be formally starting my software engineering career. However...there are a few caveats.First, new students should know that you don’t magically get all these skills just because you get into the program. I found myself frustrated by a few of my peers who seemed more focused on socializing and just getting by in the assessments than studying and finishing all the projects and assignments. Because a lot of the learning happens in pairs, a weaker partner will compromise the learning opportunities of others. It also risks the reputation of the program as a whole. However, this was more the exception than the rule. Most students worked hard, demonstrated a real passion for programming, and took what a/A taught as a foundation for more self-directed learning, and in doing so became good developers that can build almost anything. Second, just being a strong developer doesn’t guarantee you a job interview. Especially in a market weary of bootcampers. That part relies on a lot of networking and luck and doing extra side projects. So the job search is a demoralizing, grueling process to get your foot in the door. Once you get your technical or onsite, though, you’ll find that App Academy has prepared you well. Pros: - well-designed curriculum that builds incrementally on learning- teaches the most up-to-date technologies/libraries/frameworks- good balance of lectures, hands-on projects, videos, take-home assignments- reasonable hours for a bootcamp (9am-6pm, + 2-3 hours of homework) - gives a good foundation in algorithms, web architecture, and other skills necessary for interviews- based on pair programming and collaborative skills- good job search guidance for how to craft your resume, frame your past experiences, etc. - deferred tuition model reflects how much the program is invested in making you a good, employable developer- progressive values and mindset, encourages diversity and inclusiveness for all backgroundsCons: - bootcamps in general have a bad rap these days, so it seems to be a more challenging than before for grads get interviews - less rigorous screening and assessments process for students may hurt reputation in the long run- didn’t feel particularly close to my cohort or staff, but like I mentioned, that was less of a priority for me- growing student numbers might compromise quality of training in the future - some TA’s are less knowledgeable than others, but you’ll always get the help and guidance you need- there’s now more structure and support during the job search process than previous cohorts, but it’s still not enough- paying back a large percentage of salary can end up being more than other schools’ tuition if you end up getting a really good offer.

Is it really 90 hours per week worth of work?Yep, at least for many of us. People's experiences here range from never programmed before... Read More app academy to having actual software development experience (rare). But I think it's safe to say for the majority of us, it took up all of our time during the week and (for me) weekends.2. How to succeed?Work hard. Come study in the office if you can, that way you can ask other people questions. Ask questions from TA's, your smarter cohort-mates, etc.. Ask questions.3. What are the students' backgrounds?Most people fall in between professionals looking for a career change, or people straight out of college who decided they didn't want anything to do with their major. Everyone who made it through are extremely hard-working and smart.4. What do you mean ""made it through""?You can be dismissed by failing too many assessments. It does put a tremendous amount of stress on the students, however, I feel like I wouldn't have been as motivated as I was without the assessment stress. I do wish they would change the assessment structure to be more project-like though.5. Can I learn this stuff on my own? Aren't there tons of free material online for this?Extremely difficult, at least in this short amount of time. The free resources that I used seemed to go from doing for loops to ""hey now go make a project"". It's very easy to run into a bug or a question that you can't figure out when learning on your own. It's also very easy to give up. You won't have TA's to ask questions or give you feedback. When I was trying to learn this on my own, it was like running through a wall. At least at a/A, you got like 60 other people running through the same wall with you and the TA's to help.Read Less",app-academy,10525

Read More was not really going anywhere past simple games because I spent too long getting stuck, not knowing how and where to find help. After doing a little more research, I came across this bootcamp with its deferred tuition model which put me at ease in terms of getting students jobs. That and the stringent month-long admissions process which was already stretching me from a beginner-level (I had done a few projects in MATLAB and C++) and challenging my assumptions gave me an inkling that this might be the right place for me.Thankfully I was not proven wrong. The pace of the program is extremely fast, but with the benefit of being surrounded by students who are just as motivated as you. And when you get stuck the TAs in the room more than willing to help, which cuts down the learning time significantly of some of the more frustrating concepts (recursion was an early example for me). I did think at times though that there just weren't enough TAs around to help all of us; on some of the more difficult days we were waiting 20 minutes or more.Overall, I am confident that the fundamentals that App Academy taught me has prepared me well for the job search ahead.Some advice: -Don't be afraid to ask for help! Time is of the essence in a fast-paced course like this and there's no way anyone can 'get' everything that is taught in the 9 weeks as quickly as they would like. Some of the brightest classmates I knew did not hesitate to ask a TA within 10 minutes of being stuck. This is one of the biggest advantages of attending an in-person bootcamp so make use of it!-Live as close as you can to a/A during the 12 weeks. I consider myself one of the slower classmates when it comes to studying (when I see 30min reading it really means 1hr) and living 10 minutes away has saved me so many times from chopping the resource most essential to a bootcamper: sleep.-Find some way you can offer value and share it! I find that a large part of my motivation to learn about something really well is to be able to talk about it with someone later on. Our class has a Slack group where people would often share about cool things they implemented/learned and I always appreciated that.If you are willing to learn from and help others and are determined to do everything you can do deeply understand concepts, you WILL succeed.Read Less",app-academy,10525

Read More and, maybe most importantly, a capacity to efficiently learn new technical material. The coding portion of the curriculum is difficult, but at the same time structured, well organized, and jam packed with intersting and relevant material. Some of the material is presented in a lecture format, but the bulk of the work is done pair-programming with fellow students. From day 1, this model fosters collaboration and encourages students to solve problems independently, instead of following along with examples. This being said, the instructors are encouraging, readily available, and all-in-all wonderful. Many of the instructors have gone through the bootcamp program as well, so they are knowledgeable in both the technical and social/stress-management aspects of the curriculum. While there are weekly assessments, the focus of the program is for you to learn as much as possible, not to transactionally complete assigned projects / homework assignments. In this way, students come away with not only the necessary skills, but also the drive, to start their own projects. Part of the coding curriculum involves completing three large projects, all of which you effectively design and plan yourself (with the support of instructors). These three projects become the focal point of your software portfolio, and are not something that other bootcamp grads can typically claim. Aside from portfolio building, the job-search part of the curriculum is packed with mock-interviews, networking workshops, and time with a personal career coach.

While the course itself only takes 3 months, it is unlikely that you will find a job immediately after graduating. Many students take up to 3 months after AA to find a job, and some take as long as 6. You sign an agreement saying you won't take on any full-time employment during that time, so make sure you are financially stable enough to commit completely to finding an engineering position.3. Do you actually like coding? If you already know that you're just looking for a quick path to a high-paying job, you'll probably get burnt out very quickly. Obviously you don't have to live and breathe code all the time, but make sure you're doing it at least in part because you find it genuinely interesting.As long as you've thought through these possible difficulties, App Academy is ultimately a rewarding experience that will leave you impressed with the incredible progress you can make in such little time.

For one week, I worked through all the work up until mid-week 2, which I would recommend anyone do if they would like to be more prepared than their peers and feel less lost (that will happen regardless if you're new to all of this). My instructor emailed me consistently, and even helped me through the initial phases of just knowing where to type.Instructor : Coding people have a (IMO deserved) reputation of not being the best communicators. This was what scared me most about transitioning my career. I did not want to be at the mercy of someone who is crass and can't communicate with people. The instructor, Alvin, and his TA, David, were by far the best people anyone could ask for when it came to teaching the class. Alvin responds to emails usually in less than one hour (if I message him on Slack, far quicker of course), and the way he teaches, there is no way someone can fall behind. Each line of code is explained in bitter detail until everyone has a positive look on their face.Material : VIDEO WALKTHROUGHS. for every single problem on the homework or assessment, Alvin made videos walking through each one. I now have access to those walkthroughs for life on Github. If you are new to coding, these walkthroughs are your lifeblood. You can easily learn everything you need to know without stepping foot in a classroom if you have a good walkthrough for a problem set. These walkthroughs are thorough, and I used them for interview prep extensively. Competition: I was lucky(un-lucky) enough to have some extra cash to spend to seal the deal on nailing the technical interviews. I decided to enroll in Hack Reactor's prep course. I chose the premium prep option in which I was given a mentor who would design a curriculum based on my level of knowledge. I really just wanted technical interview questions so I could review them with my mentor. When I signed up, I knew fairly quickly this wasn't going to be App Academy. In order to get answers to questions as a premium prepper, I had to submit it in a certain format on a certain site, etc. When you have a question to a problem, the last thing you want is to have to go through the process of submitting it for review (and waiting 24-48 hours). The course itself was actually free, so i actually only paid for the submission of the code.My mentor, who was already uncomfortable with me just wanting to do the technical interview prep, wanted me initially to start off at ground 0 learning what a variable was. After a prickly conversation, I moved on to a video session with him. Very knowledgeable guy, I just probably wouldn't put him as the mentor to receive people at first. I asked for a refund, and received one very quickly from the very nice people there. I think Hack Reactor is a strong tiered school, but their bootcamp prep approach differs from App Academy. I can promise you, as a ground 0 student, pay the extra money and go to a/A. This is not the only experience. My business partner left his job at the same time as I did, and enrolled in Galvanize Bootcamp Prep. Galvanize has a course in which they don't even give you solutions to problems! He quickly had to leave because there were no problem reviews, and the instructor had never done the problems himself. I kid you not, he refused to answer how to do an isEven function, and instead said to ""think about how to do it"". You will never pass a technical interview with not repeatedly doing problems.Conclusion : I can't speak to full bootcamps, the other camps I mentioned have extremely strong track records of success at their full camps, and I would be lucky to get into their immersive programs. That being said, no one has put more effort into their prep than Bootcamp Prep at a/A. If you go to their course and do the work, you will be ahead of the curve come interview time.

I enrolled in App Academy, and start to finish it was an awesome experience. They had the right mix of lectures, well-written readings, and actual coding. Every day you'd be paired with a new partner, and then at night you'd have readings and homework to buff up your skills. It was a TON of work, but it was so busy and interesting that it never felt frustrating or overwhelming. It was just a matter of telling all your friends ""I can't hang out for a couple months,"" and then putting the time in. That's a tall order I'm sure, but I think it was worth it.

We all come from so many different backgrounds and lifestyles that our experiences can vastly differ from the reviews we read. However,... Read More there is one constant among us, the will to learn software development and the hope to get a great job in the industry. While I can't really comment on the second aspect (haven't actually begun job hunting yet), at the end of the day if you want to learn how to quickly and effectively develop software AND have a great time with your cohort mates and TAs, a/A is undoubtedly one of the best places you can choose to attend. A few caveats that you should pay attention to. You have to eat, sleep and breath code. You have to constantly give more and more of your time and effort as the course progresses. As soon as you think things might start slowing down and you might have room to breath, the course will get more intense. So one of the best advice I can give to any one who gets accepted into a/A: KEEP UP WITH THE WORKLOAD, regardless of your daily schedule. The curriculum is one of the best, believe in it to teach you the skills you need as long as you can do what it tells you to do. On top of that the TAs (atleast in my ""pod"") are some of the nicest, smartest and the most knowledgeable people I have ever met. Use them.The job search curriculum seems to slightly drop in quality (Not the lectures on actual job search, those are great, but the organization and content of that part of the overall course). The intensity never drops and you are forced to be more independent in your work, though do note that this is by design. You still learn buttloads of good stuff, especially on how to actually get a job which is what everything led up to. Despite that it feels a bit lacking coming from the main curriculum.On a final note. There will always be times when you feel in over your head. There will always be times when you doubt your own ability. But if you are willing to ignore those thoughts and keep pushing through with the right mindset, trust me, you will become a software developer. Hopefully I'll remember to update the review once I get a job. Until then, good luck.Read Less",app-academy,10525

For the interview process, I checked out the resources provided by App Academy to prepare for the coding challenges and found them helpful for getting a good start. I went through every possible interview round there was.. first it was a timed coding challenge which I passed, but decided to attend their Jumpstart program where you have the chance to be accepted straight into the program if you pass their assessments (Which I highly encourage if you can make it out to SF for two weeks - just email them for more information about it). Unfortunately, I didn't pass Jumpstart, so I returned to SoCal and continued with my interview process. I went through a live coding test, a homework assignment, a timed test, another live coding test, and then finally making it to the behavioral interview before receiving the acceptance email.Program:- If you are thinking about doing a career shift and have zero coding experience, know that it's possible but you will have to put in a lot of work to learn the material and not fall behind. App Academy will be difficult. They move at a really fast pace and it will be hard to keep up if you fall behind.- Be prepared to have no life outside of coding for 3 months. Because they're also open on the weekends, I went to a/A every single day during the program. Take advantage of the study area since they have computers, a restroom, and a kitchen! Why go to a coffee shop and struggle to find open seats :) There were nights where I dreamt about code, went to sleep thinking about code, and woke up thinking about code. - Don't feel down if you see that those around you are doing a lot better than you, a lot of times I realized that those around me have either coded before, taken CS classes, or have prior experience. - Make sure to study well for the assessments, they are timed so make sure to practice taking them over and over and over again if you don't do well under pressure.- Staff/TA was great! They split everyone into smaller groups, so there's a good amount of TAs per group. We had weekly circle time where we went around in a circle and talked about our week which I really liked.Job Search:- My biggest challenge was to study algorithms, data structures, and mostly CS concepts since I did not have that background, but just study consistently the areas you feel you're weak at and practice. Set up a good routine and schedule for yourself.- Constantly check in with your coach! Meet up to study and keep up the momentum or applying to jobs with your cohort mates. Support each other.- Buy yourself a whiteboard to practice writing out problems. Be comfortable talking about yourself and your projects (it's going to get repetitive)- I wanted to wait until I received a job offer to leave a review... so I am happy to say that after 4 months of job searching, I received an offer from a company I am super excited to work for!

Another 2-4 years in college was a big no-no (fool me twice, shame on me) and, for similar reasons, spending 15-20k upfront on a bootcamp with no guarantee of success seemed like a bad bet.App Academy was groundbreaking. For the first time, I found a school whose tuition model aligned with my own personal goals. The better I did, the better AA did.The rumors are all true. No amount of words can describe the rigor and the challenge of the program. An 80-90 hour weekly commitment is typical. You'll lose sleep. You'll be challenged consistently and think ""I'm not sure I can finish this"". You'll be surrounded (and outcompeted) by some of the most gifted people you'll ever meet. You'll fail to understand a topic on a Saturday and pass an exam on it on Monday. Once the learning curriculum concludes, you're thrust into the job search, which is filled with entirely different challenges -- personal projects, phone calls, take-home assessments, technical screenings, whiteboarding sessions, in-person interviews, salary negotiations.And then, almost miraculously, things start working out. You get complimented on your GitHub code at interviews, you do well at whiteboarding sessions, you get offers that are almost double what you earned at your previous job. You have the confidence to choose which offers to accept and which to reject.A single review can't do AA justice. It truly provides a life-changing experience. The TAs are phenomenal --- amazingly brilliant people who not only understand the material but have a genuine desire to help others. The in-class pair programming assignments are perfectly structured; there is enough material to ensure a good 5-6 hours a day could be spent coding. The caliber of the students is phenomenal -- lots of different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. The job placements team is stellar as well; all were confident career coaches that were eager to lift you up and fill you with optimism.All in all, I have zero regrets about the program. All promises were kept. It was the most challenging educational endeavor I've ever attempted but, thanks to App Academy, I feel confident about my future as a software engineer. If you're passionate about the field and are willing to put in the hard work, there's no better place to learn web development.Read Less",app-academy,10525

One of them accepted me right off the bat and I knew they were the wrong choiced. Others asked me to accomplish things in coding challenges that were far beyond... Read More my skill level without offering any instruction or legitimate curriculum. With App Academy, the application process was very challenging, but you are given every opportunity to succeed via their resources. Also, the actual challenges they give you are algorithm challenges, very similar to whiteboarding questions you may get when you interview for a Developer position. This is in contrast to other challenges that ask you to build a Rails Twilio application or some other project that is very practical in nature. Yes, building an application is a great way of finding out whether someone is a good programmer, but it tells you nothing of their potential. However, if you teach someone some basic programming principles and data structures: what is a string? an array? etc. and then ask them to solve a question that uses those data structures, it is a much better way to guage someones potential by seeing if they are capable of applying what they are learning. Building a full application is much too difficult a task to ask of a newbie without spelling out every step and at that point, you may as well just write the code for them.So aside from the deffered tuition (which is nice), the application process is what got me hooked on App Academy.Once you get in, first the first few weeks all you want to do is survive. You will be kicked out if you fail two exams. The first people to go are people who can't type (it's painful to watch them type with only their index fingers) and people who don't speak English as their first language. That's not to say that everyone who doesn't speak English as their first language will fail, not what I am saying. However, the sheer amount of information that will be thrown at you is mind numbing and every lick of it is in English. If there is no language barrier, you still only absorb ~75-85% of what you are taught. If there is a language barrier, that percentage drops. This makes it difficult to keep up in a very fast paced environment. I noticed the people who spoke English as a second language and did well in the class either had prior coding experience or were just insanely sedulous and dedicated to the craft. It can be done, but it is certainly harder.Once you make it past the survival phase, which is after the fourth assessment (say week 4), then you start to think, ""Ok, I don't want to just survive anymore, I want to excel."" This is where the course gets really exciting because you begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel. You start to think about things like a programmer. You get re-programmed. That's what this program does to you, it programs you to be a programmer (you like what I did there?).If you're smart, you may be wondering, ""Well what are some flaws, some bad things about App Academy"". The one thing I can point to, which I got over once I bought into the program is this: you are not attending a/A to create a startup when you graduate. I have a ton of ideas for startups, yes, but if it's one thing I learned during my time at a/A, it's that programming is very hard and it will take time (and more importantly, work experience) for you to be good. The goal of an a/A graduate is to get a job, not to start a company with a cool new application that revolutionizes an industry. Get a job, pay us back, get some experience, and then go start a company. That is the message and to be honest, I agree with it. Now some other bootcamps, like Full Stack Academy, have avenues for students to pursue their startup aspirations. This is a luxury that only a school who is already paid can afford. At a/A, they don't make money unless you do and most startups don't make money, they cost money (trust me, I know firsthand). Now, if they don't get paid unless you do, that means they have a vested interest in your getting paid. This system of deffered tuition is one that Milton Friedman espoused in his book Free To Choose. He devised this as a way to pay for education without the government paying for it, but admitted it would be very difficult to implement. Well, App Academy implemented and guess what, it works! The curriculum kicks ass. It is laid out in such a way that each topic builds on the next and moves very quickly so that every week your knowledge grows exponentially. I'm not going to go into specifics on the curriculum, the website does that. But I will say that I remember thinking often, ""Wow, this curriculum is so good."" Thank Ned Ruggeri et al!In summary, and this has been a long review, I highly recommend App Academy.Read Less",app-academy,10525

The course has a ton of great TA's, so even if you are feeling overwhelmed, there's always someone to talk to for help. Classmates come from all backgrounds and walks of life, but pretty much everyone was the same beginner when sitting down at the computer to pair. Because everyone is there for the same reason (to learn and become developers) everyone is willing to help out each other. One warning: the course isn't lying when they say you will spend upwards of 90 hours a week programming. There is plenty of work to do outside of the classroom, and you'll want to do all of it to make sure you don't fall behind. The information is actually quite interesting and the lecture videos are well done, but it will be in your favor to keep on top of the work. There's also a great alumni network to help find jobs after the course is officially finished. Because App Academy is one of the few long-lasting coding bootcamps, companies have learned that their graduates are different than other bootcamp graduates and are more willing to give potential employees the time of day.Overall, I had a great experience at App Academy.

This speaks to the dedication of the staff to producing graduates that are not only capable, but who take initiative to fill the holes in their knowledge. Pair programming is mandatory during most of App Academy's curriculum, a standard that encourages peer teaching outside of the normal class hours. This vibe sticks around, resulting in students that aren't competitive, but rather truly cooperative. Much of App Academy's value lies in their philosophy of pairing and peer teaching. Before applying to App Academy, I had read all the common sentiments in their reviews: ""It was like drinking from a firehose"", ""You really will spend 100+ hours a week"", ""It was absolutely the most difficult and most rewarding thing I've ever done"". All those things are true. There were days when I hated this place, and there were days when I loved it, and I would assume the same is true for most students who go through this program. Some days the obstacles seem insurmountable and you wonder what you're doing here; other days you wonder why you ever considered doing anything else. App Academy is a world of extremes. With extreme frustration comes the extreme satisfaction in the truth of saying ""I can do this because I just did it."" Before coming here I saw a tweet that simply read ""Do what you can't."" With the help of amazing lectures, a world-class curriculum, and TAs bordering on (or crossing into) genius, App Academy helped me do what I thought I couldn't.Read Less",app-academy,10525

A few students brought this up to the teaching staff and for the rest of the program, we stuck with the regular education team instead.

I put in a lot of hard work, often not getting home until after midnight but It was so rewarding that It felt like I was just having fun.Cons:1. The rigors of the job search. For me,... Read More the most difficult part of the entire process was the job search. I enjoy coding and solving problems but I absolutely hate sending emails and writing cover letters to try and 'sell' myself. This is not something specific to App Academy, but it is something to be prepared for. It took me over two months until I got an offer that I was happy with. About half of my cohort had to wait even longer. I know that doesn't sound like a long time but it IS when you're going through it. There were times that I didn't get any responses for weeks at a time and felt like I would never find a job.Pros:1. The tuition model. I applied when the tuition was 20% of the starting annual salary of the job I accepted. (They actually proactively lowered it to 18% because some students in my cohort had applied at that rate). For me, the low-risk payment model removed one of the greatest barriers to entry. It also gave me confidence that our goals were aligned and that success rates advertised were accurate (I too was skeptical before I experienced the outcomes first hand).2. The students. Once I got in, I began to appreciate that App Academy sets a high bar and selects only the top 3% of applicants. Learning with a group of talented and intelligent students becomes a real advantage when you get stuck, don't understand something, or just need to discuss a concept.3. The curriculum. The learning at App Academy follows a pattern of learning new material for homework, clarifying the details in the morning lecture, and hands-on experience in the afternoon projects. The curriculum is kept up to date with the latest stable technologies and focuses on applying the knowledge. For me, this helped in retaining what I had learned and cumulatively building upon it.4. The career coaching. My App Academy career coach was AWESOME! The career coaches help students polish their resumes, online profiles, and cover letter templates. They also help to find and fix the bottlenecks in the job search. (For me it was the online profiles and resume. For others, it was practicing technical interviewing or adding features to their showcase projects). They give personalized advice and help keep graduates motivated when they're going through a rough patch.Read Less",app-academy,10525

363,239019,0,,2017.0,1,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"General Summary: I wholeheartedly enjoyed my twelve weeks at App Academy. The program provides an intense, unique experience. Basically, it lasts twelve weeks: the first nine weeks comprise the “Technical Curriculum” and the last three the “Job Search... Read More Curriculum”. However, after being admitted and accepting your offer, you have to complete a one-month online course called “Alpha Prep” before starting. The technical curriculum is intense. In seven weeks, you will learn all the material you need to be able to develop your own React/Rails web app from scratch in the eighth and ninth weeks. On a daily basis, you will have many projects (whose material you covered in readings and videos the night before) to work on with your partner. You’ll learn Ruby, Postgresql, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React/Redux. However, pair programming and the “question button” system serve to alleviate some of the stress of the course. Pair programming is basically you coding on a single pc (and keyboard) with a partner. Every fifteen minutes, you switch “drivers”, i.e., the person who is physically typing on the keyboard. For the first couple of days, you might feel uncomfortable having to code all day with a partner, but the benefits of doing so become apparent soon after. Having to verbalize and communicate problems to someone else rather than hacking away at the keyboard forces you to become methodical in your approach, and it helps you ask better questions when you’re stuck. The “question button” is a button on the internal web app that puts your name on a question queue. The TA’s are pinged every time a person is added, and they come by to field students’ questions on a first-come, first-served basis. The benefit of this system is that it allows all students an equal opportunity to have their questions answered and it deals with the issue of less vocal or visible students receiving less attention. The job search curriculum begins in the tenth week. By that point, you will have learned all the skills you need to develop fully functioning web apps from scratch. However, simply because you have learned the technical material doesn’t mean the course becomes less intense. In these three weeks, you will work on your résumé, cover letters, online presence, personal pitch, and whiteboarding problems. In this aspect of the course, you will receive a lot of support from the career coaches. They will review your projects portfolio, résumé, etc, in depth and will give you detailed pointers on how to improve each item.	Pros:	The TA’s are always on call, and they generally are able to pinpoint your problem within seconds and do not leave you until all your doubts are assuaged.Almost the projects serve some practical use, and the emphasis on repetition ensures that you internalize the material.Pair programming makes the experience more enjoyable, and it ensures that you rarely get bogged down with trivial bugs.The career coaches provide a lot of support in the job search. They help with your portfolio, personal pitch, networking skills, online presence, and negotiation.App Academy’s alumni network is helpful and supportive.Cons:The curriculum is constantly being updated so sometimes you will find some inconsistencies in the material. This problem does not appear so much in the 12-week program itself, but it is definitely noticeable and distracting in the Alpha Prep course. As much as I love pair programming, you will have days where you work with someone you find intolerable. Fortunately, this only happened to me three days out of the roughly 35 in which you pair program, but this experience is variable.There are six assessments throughout the course, and they are a bit stressful because if you fail any two of them, you are asked to leave the program with your initial deposit refunded. Moreover, because they are graded automatically, they are unforgiving--meaning that a single typo can cause code with otherwise sound logic to fail their automated tests. However, the expectations of the assessments are straightforward and you are given plenty of time and material to prepare for them.Caveats:If you are not an independent learner, you will have a hard time at App Academy. Despite the great amount of support you will have, there is a lot of material and little time. If you assume App Academy is like a traditional educative program where the student plays a more passive role, you will likely struggle through it. This is not a criticism of the instructors (I hold them in high esteem), but it is simply the nature the program.You will not have time for anything else. This is not an exaggeration. I taught myself to code for half a year before attending App Academy so the first three weeks were relatively light for me. That being said, I was only able to have weekend evenings free during this time. When it came time to create our web apps from scratch, I literally had no time for anything else even on the weekend. Some people assume that the job search curriculum is less intense than the technical curriculum. This is not true so don’t get your hopes up!Read Less",app-academy,10525

I don't believe that sways my opinion, but I feel it's fair that you know the context.I'm writing this review having just completed my first 9 weeks of App Academy. In the last 9 weeks, (really... Read More 13 since there's about 4 weeks of prepwork assigned before the course starts), I've gone from 0 experience as a web developer to having created my own full stack web app using a Ruby on Rails backend with a React with Redux frontend. I can't speak yet to the quality of their job search curriculum, which I will go through over the next 3 weeks, but I will say that their full stack curriculum is absolutely effective for a few reasons. First, you should know that some of the students, roughly 15% in my cohort, were dismissed for not passing assessments before completing the curriculum, so being accepted is only the beginning of the journey. The ones who made it through are absolutely better programmers for having gone through the program. Many of my classmates started with little to no experience programming, and are full-fledged web developers now.I believe the reason a/A is so effective is, in a word: reps. Every day, there are 2 hours of lecture, and then you peer program for 5-6 hours. Then there are homeworks and readings to do before you get to class. Shower, sleep, and repeat for 9 weeks. Peer programming is a process through which you sit down and talk through and try to solve problems with someone else. There are many factors conducive to learning and skill development at play during this time. First, learning to verbalize your approach to a problem is immensely helpful to refining and solidifying knowledge. Second, having the accountability to keep trying to solve the problem and having help when you need it keeps the learning process moving. Third, an understated part of programming is looking up and researching documentation, which you will get a lot of practice doing. Last but not least, you are experiencing the same thing while you drive and your partner navigates, so you have the benefit of differing perspectives every day. Before I started a/A, I thought these skills were something I could learn on my own, but would be faster with a teacher. That's partly true, but it's also true that your fellow students aid in the learning process immensely. If I were describing a/A to a prospective applicant, I would tell you to look at it as an opportunity. An opportunity to work hard and learn. That's all it is. It's intense, but if you make it out, you will have absolutely developed hard, bankable skills as a programmer.Read Less",app-academy,10525

You can be an insanely fast learner, 2. you can already have experience in the field of software development, or 3. you have to be almost bulldogged in your persistence. Everyone in my cohort was a joy to work with and they were all super smart and super helpful. The test structure forces you to learn the test more that learn the fundamentals. While this causes stress, and the experience of losing classmates to the rigid testing system was awful I feel like it is in place to maximize the schools success rate.

Those are the people that are most likely to get jobs and be successful. Overall I feel like I have learned a lot and that I have at least the ability to continue learning and improving.

I'll cover the scary before I cover the positives.You need a lot of grit, determination, and motivation. The overall pace of the course is extremely fast, and it challenges your studying habits and your ability to overcome nearly incomprehensible material being thrown at you at lightning speed. 9 hours of class time per day along with hours of homework each night means that you end up eating and breathing code for 70-90 hours per week. Weekly assessments are given to ensure that everyone is on track, and two failures means you get removed; about a dozen people from the cohort didn't make it to the end and it kinda sucks seeing them leave. You could feel the stress hormones through the roof, and over half of the cohort experienced failing one assessment and the doomsday mindset that followed. There was an unfortunate tradeoff between fully understanding the material and studying for the assessments, and most people opted for leaving the understanding to after the assessments were over. I did not experience the stress that most people did, but it's common enough to be worth mentioning. That being said, the amount that you end up learning is quite impressive. No one could learn all this through self-study at the pace that they teach it here. At the end of nine weeks, I found myself with a fully functional single-page web app built on Rails and React/Redux, which was super cool (too bad they don't teach this kind of stuff in college).

My classmates were all super chill and bright folks, and it was an absolute pleasure to be working alongside them and pairing with them every day. I can't say I miss pair programming, but I can say I enjoyed it a lot and experienced a lot of growth that I never experienced when I was self-teaching programming.I feel prepared for the job search, and I know that I will be much more successful in the search than I would have been had I tried to pursue this path through self-study.Read Less",app-academy,10525

Read More I HIGHLY recommend doing it - you get a great taste of what the real program is like, including overall instruction-style, assessments, pair-programming, basic material, etc. and it reportedly greatly improves your chances of getting accepted into the program). Review: Overall, I would say that App Academy lives up to its ranking and is a great experience for turning someone like me, with absolute minimal tech / coding background, and in just 3 months turning this person into someone who can create a web app from scratch and can comfortably apply to jobs in that field. That being said, everything everyone says about the workload and intensity is completely accurate and you need to take it seriously. I gave up the vast majority of my life's activiities outside of a/A out of necessity - you really need to put in every weeknight and most of your every weekend into catching up if you're behind, getting ahead if you're not, or studying for the next week's assessment. Being someone who wasn't as naturally gifted or previously trained in the field, I had to work much, much harder and put in way more effort than those people so that I could still contribute and be productive in my daily pairings, projects, assessments, etc. Pairing - I found the pair-programming experience to be one of the most educational and enjoyable aspects of the program. Every day you are assigned a new partner to work with for the entirety of that day. You work through (and rarely complete) all of the day's projects together and over that time end up learning a lot, both about the person and about the day's material. Whether you find yourself to be the faster/more knowledgeable of the pair, or the slower/less knowledgeable, you end up learning at least a few things by day's end. Sometimes your partner will know a few cool keyboarding shortcuts in Atom that you hadn't seen before, or they will know some tidbit about Javascript formatting that you end up following yourself every time after, or they will have some alternative strategy to solving a problem that you find much easier to follow than the normal methods. I didn't have a single bad pairing experience in all 7 weeks of my pairings, half the time you end up eating lunch with your partner and talk, and most of the time by the end of the day you end up befriending one more person in your cohort. While everyone is learning the material at different speeds, you find that there are no ""dumb"" people in your cohort, every one is highly intelligent in different ways; they are the 2% that made it in with you and each is inherently capable of getting through it. Assessments - The assessments were definitely one of the more difficult aspects for me. The assessment policy is: out of 6 assessments in the first 8 weeks of the program, if you fail 2 of them (failure usually being defined around 85%), you are asked to leave the program, that day. This is where I find my only cons with the program. Having to leave the program that day, in front of all of your classmates, is downright brutal and borderline humiliating. If anything it motivates you that much more in your studying to avoid such an experience but I still think it is overly harsh - a simple email that night instead would be a less degrading situation, in my opinion. I also don't like that because of this intense ""Survivor""-style policy, I was often put into the very difficult situation of having to choose between fully completing the readings/videos, and hw assignments for the weekend, or studying sufficiently for that week's assessment to avoid expulsion. While I tried to balance this as best as I could and ultimately did make it through, I hated having to make that decision each week and having to compromise my getting-ahead for that week. To get you through all of it, there is an amazing team of warm, highly-gifted instructors and TA's who come to your aid either in person or online at the push of a button and explain concepts and bugs to you until both of you are confident that you fully understand, all of your highly-motivated, chill-mannered classmates, and of course, Google :).Read Less",app-academy,10525

You can really tell that everything they do is to try to set you up for success. The work space is available 24/7 and there's always a TA available to help, whether it be in person or on Slack. It is important to note that while everything is laid out for your success in the course, how far you'll go is 100% dependent on the work that you put in. Due to there being no grades (aside from weekly assessments), it is sometimes easy for students to overlook some homework assignments and projects. If you're someone who likes to barely scrape by and do the bare minimum, then you're going to be in for a bad time. I had a few pairs I worked with that did not complete any readings and seemed very behind and those people ended up being the ones asked to leave after failing two assignments. On the contrast, those who study JUST for the assessments and put other parts of the curriculum on the backburner may pass all of them, will sometimes end up hurting themselves during final projects and end up having to relearn a lot of concepts that were not covered in the assessments. You really do get what you put into the program and knowing/balancing what concepts to focus on becomes a really important thing to learn over the course of the 12 weeks. Overall, App Academy was definitely worth it for me. If you're looking for a change in your life and you think that web development may be for you, I would urge you to apply. If you get through the application process and get accepted, the only thing that you will need to get all the way through the course is having the right mindset.Read Less",app-academy,10525

Read More the program, have come out with a complete entry-level knowledge of full-stack development. The resources that have helped me from getting from point A to B in such a short amount of time was the rigor and depth of a/A’s curriculum. The most important reason is that the curriculum is so effective is that class-time enforces students to be immersed in programming and coding challenges for a maximum amount of time. The pair-programming aspect of the curriculum is a strong way to enforce communication skills and forces students to have a deeper understanding of new lessons when they are encouraged to explain their thought-process to their peers. The quality of said peers is also generally excellent in terms of character and ability. While pairing chemistry will never be perfect between every student, it was always evident to me that my peers took their time in the program very seriously and were always concerned with learning the material deeply, preparing for each class adequately, and producing high-quality work. The teaching staff is also generally excellent. I found that the quality of individual instructors would often correlate to their time in the program, but because the curriculum is so intense, the more junior instructors themselves also appear to improve quite rapidly. While there was sometimes a quality gap between new and veteran instructors, the actual time-difference between the former and the latter was usually only a cohort or two. And generally, I found that the entire package of TAs, who do all of the teaching at App Academy, was excellent and foundational to my own learning in the program.As for the cons, the largest is definitely the intense and disheartening aspects of the assessment structure of the curriculum. Personally, the assessments were the most important reason that I spent so much time working and studying outside of class hours. This is because if you fail two assessments, plus a single retake opportunity, you are dismissed from the course. With a weekend full of intense studying, I personally found the assessments to be fair and the course will give preparation materials that strongly correspond to the actual assessment. On the other hand, sometimes peers cannot make it through the grind of assessments: I believe that these individuals that were dismissed from the program do have the potential to be good programmers in the working world, and it was likely the pace of the curriculum, more so than its sheer technical difficulty, that was the largest hump to get over. Overall, my advice to prospective future students is that if you are confident in your programming abilities coming into the first week of the program, expect to still spend a lot of time on assessments and digesting the enormous amount of material from the week prior. If you are coming in less-confident, or even worse, having rushed through the four weeks of prep work, then expect to spend an extraordinary amount of time (and lack of sleep) on keeping your head above water. While the assessment structure does force students to master the material, for the most part, the stressful atmosphere that it creates through the whole school is an unfortunate trade-off.Finally, I wanted to comment on the quality of the facilities, which is important because students spend most of their hours here. During my cohort, the New York office got a significant upgrade in amenities and privacy. Before, both concurrent cohorts shared a single loft space with poor water pressure, mediocre bathrooms, and sometimes inconsistent internet. Now, each cohort gets their own floor to work on, and the office space includes a decent kitchen setup outfitted with utensils, plateware, drinking mugs/glasses, and a dishwasher. Most importantly, the coffee and teas offered by the building were significant upgrades over Folgers and Lipton. These small touches, for me, actually made a tremendous quality-of-life improvement; since most of our time will be in front of screens in the office, it’s good that the peripheral comforts are well-appointed.All-in-all I would recommend App Academy to those who want to make a tremendous career shift to a good field in the least amount of time possible. My warnings are regarding its pace, difficulty, and the toll it can take on your personal well-being.Read Less",app-academy,10525

A lot of people fail out because they didn't take it seriously.3.

For example, you'll learn back-end user authentication for Rails week 4. You'll study back-end user auth for one of the assessments. Then you'll learning front-end user authentication week 7. In week 8, you'll combine back-end and front-end for in class projects AND your full stack project.- There is are HUGE emphasis on having readable code (having good syntax + variable names so other people can understand your code), DRY code , and the importance of modularity. These are all key concepts to any software developer.- App Academy has a job search curriculum other top bootcamps do not have. You go over frequently interviewed topics.- Learning so many things in 3 months though is mentally tiring. However, don't give up. Just keep learning. Once a week, I'll question if App Academy made a mistake in accepting me. I'll hit a huge conceptual roadblock and feel inferior to my peers. However, no pain, no gain. Usually the day after, I'll have more time to reflect on what I just learned and be able to use those skills right away in the current project.Culture:- The culture is so welcoming and inviting.- I felt other bootcamps I was interested had a more top-down culture. App Academy is more collaborative. - The emphasis is to learn and grow, not just plow through the material as fast as possible.- You can tell the staff loves what they do. There are cute animal references and memes all throughout the curriculum/lectures.Pro-Tip: - Use your weekends to the fullest.

In undergrad, I did not study anything tech-/coding-related. The job had very nice people but I found the work (or lack of it) underwhelming. Having dipped my... Read More toes into the tech industry with this company, and having some familiarity with coding through Codecademy, I explored online how I could gain the skills I needed to have a career in tech.At first, I did an online graduate course through a university. The curriculum had holes (and it would have taken 2 years to get the degree). Based on that experience, I decided to look into coding bootcamps. I found out about App Academy through SwitchUp, which appeared as the top result of my google search.Looking through the different programs listed, not all of them had full-stack curricula. When I applied to some of them, all they had was a Skype interview and maybe some online prep material. App Academy stood out in that it had practice problems to solve, then an online coding challenge, then a technical interview, then an interview for cultural fit. It had by far the most fleshed-out, formal process from my experience.In addition, the deferred tuition model is appealing. But bear in mind the corresponding risks. If you have been a strong student academically or have prior experience coding, you will very likely make it through App Academy's curriculum. However, as App Academy scales, the 5% dropout rate of old is inaccurate--it's more like 20-25% in recent cohorts. The upside is that if things don't work out, you don't pay 100% of the cost. The downside is if you really want to get into software development, getting kicked out would really hamper that.How App Academy frames it is whether or not things work out for you, i.e. you are able to learn what they teach. Let me say: the curriculum is superb, the environment is supportive, and you are able to fail 2 of the 6 unit assessments and still make it through if you pass the retake of the second test.So as you compare your options, consider whether you are willing to pay $17,000 upfront to another top-rated full-stack program that won't kick you out, or if you believe you will respond well to App Academy's incentives and view the coding bootcamp more as a way to discover whether or not you want to be a software developer.All that said, if you make it through, you will build a clone of a major tech site. You will understand how the frontend, the backend, the database, middleware, and everything else functions. You will have a culture which facilitates a transition into tech extremely well (as you'll be pair-programming much of the day, every day).The last thing I'll note is that cultural fit is important. Please make sure App Academy seems like the right fit for you.Read Less",app-academy,10525

I'll discuss some reservations I had about App Academy, and some tips for future applicants/attendees. I come from a liberal arts background, and have never... Read More taken a computer science course before I started Jumpstart (a great way to get ready for App Academy's admissions process if you are offered a spot in the program). To be honest, I had reservations about the price tag of App Academy and whether it would be worth it ($22k+ is a lot of money).But as the course progressed, those reservations disappeared as I really realized that there was absolutely no way that I could have learned the amount of material on my own in such a short period of time. Prior to App Academy, I had a pretty decent job with great benefits at a private university, and part of the reason why I decided to leave that job was because of the amount of waste that I saw funded by student debt and high tuition prices. In contrast, App Academy's model of deferred tuition is still pretty revolutionary even if you have to pay a $5k deposit. I think part of what makes it work is that the student to instructor ratio is pretty low (I think it's around 1 to 8 or maybe 1 to 7 as we did loose 12 members of our cohort who did not pass the assessments). Again, that sort of student to instructor ratio is not something that is possible in most higher ed settings. There are 6 assessments throughout the course, and if you fail 2 (you are offered one opportunity for a retake after the second assessment), you are asked to leave the course. This causes a super stressful environment where many of the students are scared of failing out. The assessments do force you to internalize the material in a way that you probably wouldn't if you didn't have the assessments. In my opinion, the assessments are a flawed tool for measuring student progress, especially because it causes a lot of students to focus on just what would/could be on the test, but it is App Academy's way of measuring that you have the minimum amount of knowledge to continue progressing in the course (as I do think a few cohort mates who were asked to leave could have done well and finished if they had been allowed to stay). Aside from 1.5 to 2 hours of lecture, most of your day is spent pair programming with the same person for the whole day (for some projects, two days). Pair programming really does help you solidify your understanding, as you have to verbally communicate your thoughts to another person and vice versa, and forces you to stay on track the whole day. Except for maybe 2 instances, I found pair programming to be a very enjoyable experience. I will say that even if you've never taken a computer science course, and even if you struggle to keep up throughout most of the course, if you are comfortable with pushing your boundaries and keep up with the course material, you can succeed. Prior to starting the actual course, App Academy gives you materials (Alpha course) to study on your own. Make sure you do all of it (twice, if possible!) and give yourself time to do it. This will set you up for success. They recommend 4 weeks for this prep work, but especially if you plan on working right up till you start the course, I would say you need more like 6 to 8 weeks. The last thing I wanted to say was aside from the mental exertion and total time commitment for 12 weeks, I found the course to be physically grueling, and felt absolutely exhausted the first two weeks of the course. So, I think this is also something to keep in mind when considering which bootcamp to attend. But overall, I highly recommend App Academy!Read Less",app-academy,10525

Read More over the past months, but in exchange I've gained an extremely valuable skill in less time than I could have imagined before beginning the program.The instructors are top-notch. Everything in general is conducted extremely professionally, from the location and the building/amenities (I attended the NY branch), to the assessments and the projects. Before joining the program I was under the impression that I could have learned all of the same skills on my own, using free resources online. Looking back now, this miiiiight be possible, but it honestly would have taken me more than 10 times as long to do alone. Having the instructors on call, and the other students as pair-programmers was indispensable for me. Again, the program is totally worth it for those who are serious about becoming full-stack developers. But again, there is no hand-holding. If you think you can give it anything less than 90% of your time and attention, you will likely fail out.Read Less",app-academy,10525

If I remember, I will go back and edit this after going through the job search. I have greatly enjoyed my time at App Academy so far. Looking back, it is astounding how much... Read More ground we have covered in that time. Myself and all my classmates have just finished our full stack web applications—and it amazes me how far we were able to take them. I remember sitting in the classroom on the first day, apprehensive and excited to start learning… since then it has been a whirlwind of learning and doing. You will look back and marvel at how far you have come in so little time. That being said, this program is hard work. You will need to steel yourself for long nights and stressful exams and projects. Some, of course, will have an easier time than others depending on your background and how well you’ve prepared for the bootcamp. But at one point or another, everyone who gets through puts in a lot of time and effort to do so.I have often been running on 5-7 hours of sleep—less on particularly intensive nights. I estimate I’ve put in roughly 80-90 working hours a week (more if you include my commute each day). If you want to keep up and get all the readings/activities done, expect to be spending many hours learning and coding. Fortunately, if you’re anything like me and most of my cohort-mates, then you’ll enjoy learning software development. By this point you’ve probably read a lot of reviews telling you App Academy is hard for many people. This is true. Some do not make it to the end. About 15 people from our class failed two assessments and a retake and were asked to leave as a result. However, I am a firm believer that if you’ve gotten through the applications process at App Academy, you have what it takes to make it to the end. If you end up going to App Academy, please believe in yourself, and work your ass off. A good number of my classmates failed the first assessment (by far the easiest one), bunkered down, and killed the rest. Do not be discouraged if you stumble. I’d like to close my review with some advice for prospective students. I have done fairly well with the program thus far and think it is prudent of my to share some of my preparation and study strategies that got me to where I am.1.	If you’re looking for introductory materials, I definitely recommend the MIT eDX course, ‘Introduction to Programming in Python’2.	Do as much preparation as possible. Of particular help to me was training fundamentals in Ruby on codewars. Aside from that, do what interests you from the options below:a.	Learn HTML5 and CSS3 at least to a basic level. In particular, learn the basic input types for html and how to use flex in CSS (look up flexbox froggy). If you can, try and recreate static versions of popular webpages from pure html and css.b.	Learn SQL. We did this is about half a week, but it was pretty rough for some. If you’re dedicated, you can do the same and not have to stress about it during the course.c.	Learn about the Model, View, Controller design pattern and its advantages/tradeoffs. Research ruby/rails or some other framework and see if you can learn the basics of app development. I would not recommend doing this before having a solid grounding in all the fundamentals though.d.	For the mathematically inclined with time before the course begins, go follow along with an algorithms course online. Learn big-O notation and algorithmic analysis. I personally followed along with the free MIT OCW lectures and assignments for 6.042J with Tom Leighton and 6.006 with Srini Devadas. If you already feel comfortable with basic programming and want to be ahead of the game for the job search, this is a good option for you. e.	If you really want to go the extra mile like me, go ahead and read a design patterns book (I used Head First Design Patterns, but Gang of Four is the canonical work to reference)3.	During the course, hit the ground running and do all the readings you can. Definitely drop all other responsibilities (or as many as possible). You don’t want to be dealing with anything else while tackling the curriculum. If you have a decent commute, it will be fairly impossible to do anything else. Speaking of the commute, preload the readings and download the videos they give you so you can watch them offline on your way there/back. If you can, study in the office around others where you can ask your classmates questions. If the homework is taking you too long, just send it up and put it away—you will be going over the material in greater detail tomorrow. 4.	Lastly, and most importantly: Make friends! You have the opportunity to study alongside many with similar motivations and career goals. Your classmates will be among your greatest resources during the course and moving forward. The people who are thriving in my cohort are largely those who made an effort to be social work with their classmates. Coming in to week 9, I can count a number of my them as good friends who I can expect to keep in contact with for years to come. For that reason alone, it was worth it to me to attend App Academy, and they’ve made my time here feel so nice. Good luck to all applicants and soon-to-be students!Read Less",app-academy,10525

And after going through the curriculum, I now understand what they were saying about the difficulty of... Read More this course and why they were saying it. BUT I also understand why App Academy still gets all these amazing reviews. Difficulty: This course is HARD. On day 1, the head instructor made a joke that we should tell our friends and family that we're going on a 12 week cruise. He was joking, but at the same time... he wasn't. My personal experience of the workload at App Academy was get to class around 7//7:30am to finish up whatever homework I didn't complete the night before, 9am-6pm class time. 6pm -8:30//9pm homework and then rinse and repeat for Mon-Fri. Generally I would take Friday night off to give myself a mental break, but Saturday and Sunday you could find myself and most of the App Academy Students in the classroom Studying for the Assessments. TLDR: This class is no joke. You cannot have a social life and succeed in this bootcamp. (At the very least don't expect to unless, you may be able to get a night out here and there if somehow you're ahead on the material)Assessments:Yes this is one of the few BootCamps that relies on Assessments. Yes they are very stressful. Yes there is a lot of practice work given to help you pass these assessments. Yes they are hard. HOWEVER, I couldn't be happier that we had these assessments. At the end of the day, you can sit through the lectures, you can do the homeworks and finish the in class assignments, but practicing and studying for these assessments is what really drills the information into your brain. Keep in mind though, you can be removed from the program if you fail two assessments. This can make the program a lot more stressful for people who are either not good test takers or do not put the work in. These assessments are not made to trick you, but made to make sure you know the minimum amount of knowledge to continue with the program. Without that minimum knowledge, you will not succeed with the rest of the program.TLDR: Assessments are hard, but not if you keep up with the work and study on weekends. Bad test takers, bewareInstructors:The instructors are absolutely awesome. All instructors are extremely knowledgeable in the topics being taught, and clearly have extensive experience in teaching the material. They're all also extremely helpfulCulture:The Culture at a/A is extremely welcoming, and I can tell that I will remain friends with many of my cohort-mates for many years to come. We've spent many many hours in class together and even more on slack.Worth it?100%. We are just starting the job application process now, but from everyone I've talked to who is in a place to hire Software Developers, App Academy consistently trains the strongest job candidates from all the other BootCamps in NYC. No matter your background or previous experience in coding, you can succeed in this class with the right amount of work. I personally did not have any coding experience and am currently feeling super confident going into the job search process. TLDR of the entire review - If you've already made the decision to take up a bootcamp, willing to sacrifice 12 weeks of your social life, and wand the best bang for your buck, App Academy is the choice.Read Less",app-academy,10525

CurriculumThe curriculum is easily the strongest part of App Academy. It is truly incredible how much knowledge you will walk away with if you are able to pace yourself and be consistent in doing all of the readings and preparing for the lectures everyday. They offer a lot, but they also require a lot out of you and it is difficult to keep up unless you are able to motivate yourself everyday.Luckily they provide intrinsic motivation due to pair programming and assessments. Knowing that you have to work with a different person everyday helps you make sure to try to get a good understanding of the subject matter so that you don't slow your partner down. Most importantly knowing that you could be kicked out by failing too many assessments will also motivate you to keep up. This was a main motivator for me attending, because I knew it would always keep me on my toes.At the end of the main curriculum you will be able to build a fullstack web application that is dynamic, complex, and impressive. That ten day project will be one of the most tiring experiences of your life, but you will be quite proud when you are done. Be sure to celebrate with your cohort mates when it's over.DiversityI added this category because I think it's important to note that App Academy is below average when it comes to racial/gender diversity. My cohort was about 5% women and 10-15% non white/asian. This did not affect my experience at all, as someone from an under-represented group, but I cannot speak for everyone and thought it should be noted for others considering App Academy.InstructorsThe instructors are usually App Academy grads. There is a question button during pair programming, which calls over a TA to assist you when you and your partner are stuck. They are all very cool, helpful, and the lectures are incredibly informative. The lectures will usually go over the reading and assignments for the night before and introduce some new material for the day ahead, so make sure you come prepared. Job AssistanceThe Job Search Curriculum in the last three weeks can feel a bit anticlimactic. You've just spent 9 weeks going 100mph and then all of the sudden things slow down quite a bit. It can be a good thing because everyone is a bit burnt out from the fullstack project, but I wish there was a way to keep a similar pace going. Here you will work on your portfolio, build a nice online presence, learn how to approach networking, applying, negotiating etc. Don't come in thinking App Academy is going to provide you with all kinds of contacts and connections. I don't think they have any more ability to get you a job than any other bootcamp. However, they have a great reputation with companies in NYC and SF and a huge alumni network in those respective cities. I attended App Academy in NYC and I can tell you there are companies that only hire App Academy grads because the curriculum is more in depth and the projects are more impressive. OutcomePersonally, I applied to 305 jobs, had 6 phone screens, 3 on-sites, 2 offers, and landed an awesome job at a startup in NYC 3 months after graduating and I couldn't be happier. The job search is an absolute grind, but don't get discouraged. Just stick with it, apply everywhere, and don't say no to yourself! You never know who will get a job, even if everyone applies to the same one. There is a lot of luck involved and each person is unique even though you all graduated from the same course.Be financially responsible, make sure you have enough of a safety net so that you can focus, and it'll all come together in the end.Read Less",app-academy,10525

It’s stressy. But the thing about stress is that it can make you grow. This is a data-driven insight, based... Read More in real neuroscience-- it's evolutionarily adaptive for people to be imprinted with vivid memories when experiencing raised stress levels. Being confronted with more material than you could possibly work through in the time allotted is both intimidating and inspiring, and App Academy will often introduce new material before old has had a chance to sink in-- this means that you always have a ton going on in the background. Maybe that’s why a majority of the class has literally had dreams about code-- I had one just last night about a non-existent interactive blue screen of death app! You end up with little option but to work on code from roughly 9a until 10 or 11p most nights, as well as studying all weekend. it's literally not possible to keep up otherwise. If you don't like other people controlling your schedule, this isn’t great. But nonconformists can do well here. Myself, I come from a background in nightlife and production, and found it easy to not really go out for three months. I’ve never been much for structure, I can barely enjoy bowling, what with their ‘lanes’ and ‘scoring systems.’ But having a path hewn ahead of us through the jungle of code education has been extremely helpful in helping me stay focussed and avoid wasting time-- they really do point you directly towards engagement with concepts that will get you producing good work, learning more fundamental concepts, and collaborating well with others.Like all school, you get out what you put in. But unlike some other boot camps, if you don't put enough in, you'll be asked to leave-- our cohort shed about ten people who failed the high-pressure, closed-book, timed assessments who either had crippling test anxiety, poor time management, attempted to party or do other work during the cohort, or, more rarely, couldn't absorb the material. It's up to you whether this is more of a motivation or an inspiring call to fluency under time pressure than something that freaks you out and makes you want to cry. If you don’t like high-pressure testing, there may well be other boot camps that are a better fit, which would not mean you're dumb. Some people who've been asked to leave after failing assessments (with a relatively generous prorated refund and kind words) have gone on to be TA's at other boot camps!While being demanding on your time, App Academy also asks for a lot of independence. Much of the curriculum is written in a relatively terse style that demands the reader both be able to read closely through dense instructions and to be comfortable doing more and more independent research as the curriculum goes on, just like a real dev. The teachers are available to get you unstuck, but you’re encouraged to learn more about solving your own problems every day, and when coding in pairs, you will do tons of mutual troubleshooting, basically proving to each other that you can both teach and learn-- it is very normal to just engage with whoever’s closest to you about whatever bug you’re in the middle of, and people uniformly treat that as an opportunity to practice teaching and cement knowledge than as an interruption. The job search requires you to have a lot of discipline and follow-through, and it is very likely you will continue self-educating exhaustively throughout your career. Is it for everybody? No! But if it's for you, it's the best place you could be.Read Less",app-academy,10525

The course runs you through a bunch of languages and libraries in a short amount of time but does so in a way that works for most people.

With that being said, the entire team is there to support you as much as they can.

I was a hobbyist programmer that taught myself C++ and Objective-C but I knew that web development was something that I needed to... Read More know to succeed as a programmer. So I decided to start reading up on short web development programming schools. I applied and was accepted to each 'boot camp' I applied to--including a/A and Hack Reactor. I picked a/A because I was focused more on how well I perceived their job search support to be. At the time, I felt that I really wouldn't learn too much programming principals but instead learn some frameworks and syntax with whatever boot camp I applied to. Well I was wrong. I learned things like recursion and time complexity at a/A. I don't know how long it would have taken me to even know these things existed if I was learning solely on my own. They are very encouraging throughout the entire process, but especially during the job search. That's not to say they hold your hand throughout the process--you're expected to be a self-starter and ask questions if you're behind. They are more than willing to help, but you've got to ask questions. One thing that I had mixed feelings about was the attrition rate (or amount of people that either got kicked or left the program.) When I signed up the a/A website said attrition was around 5%, now it says it's around 10%. But for my cohort and the cohort before mine it was about 20%. For me, this is a risk that I would not have taken if I knew it was this high. It's 3 months without work and no security that you will be allowed to continue through the program unless you pass all 6 assessments. From my cohort most people that failed out failed either to not putting in the work or being overly stressed about it and either not getting any sleep or overthinking the solutions. Much of passing the tests are memorization. The positive to this is that they are very selective (3% admittance rate like the other top boot camps) but in contrast to the other boot camps this one will continue filtering out students that they feel aren't going to work out in programming where as others will just push them through it. This makes the a/A brand an extremely strong mark on your resume. Overall, I suggest attending this boot camp if you have confidence in your ability to program going into it, but perhaps take a few timed tests or join their Jump Start or boot camp prep program to see if you will cut it if you're unsure.Read Less",app-academy,10525

It definitely moves at a fast pace to try to shove as much information into you. TLDR: You will learn alot in a very short amount of time. This program is really about you getting the most out of it so be prepare to work for it. If this is your dream, if this is your passion, then follow through on it.App Academy is tough, make no mistake about it. I never felt entirely comfortable with the material until a couple of days later and by that time the course may have moved into something completely new. The dreaded assessments are there to make sure you understand the bare minimum as the material stacks upon itself (and in all honesty, I feel is why a/A graduates are very strong as you are forced to practice the material repeatedly to truly understand it). The material you cover will be shallow/medium depth, touching surfaces of various technologies and topics but let face it, you will be learning so much including just the ability in how to tackle new problems or to learn new technologies. The lectures and readings are very strong and but the key in all this is the immersive pair programming, tackling difficult programs with your cohort mates although you an buzz in a helpful TA if you get truly stuck. I'm currently at week 8 but I can truly say I feel like a software developer. As long as you can keep up with the material, I think you will be fine. I usually got around 6 hours of sleep a day.a/A gives you everything you need to become a junior level Software Engineer and it really is up to you to decide how much you can get out of it.

You have no idea what is going on (for a while), but somehow it always works out just fine. Being able to code... Read More full-time is amazing on its own, and having a supportive environment is way better than fighting alone. Some tips for future students:- About your peers: Most of my classmates have some coding background or self-studied some languages, while others didn't code before attending aA. There are CS graduates, and people with non-tech background. It is a diverse group, but one thing is in common: everyone is pretty passionate about coding and wants to make it. - About prior experience: Some people have asked me if they can attend without coding experience. In my opinion, having prior experience or not is not the deciding factor. The most important thing is making sure that you really want this. People have different learning styles, so think about whether you like a fast-paced environment.- That being said, do consider the potential risk of being dismissed after two failures in assessments. We have 6 assessments in total. In our cohort and previous cohort, the dismiss rate is about 20%. - If you can, try to learn data structures and algorithms before you start aA. In aA, recursion is taught in one day. It is helpful to know basics such as Big O time complexity, sorting algorithms, etc. before you start this program. Two of the assessments are about algorithms (in Ruby and JavaScript).- I also hope I had known more CSS before I came in. CSS is relatively easy to learn on one's own, but there are so many details. In aA we don't learn a lot about CSS in the curriculum, just because it is not the focus of the curriculum. Core curriculum includes Ruby, Rails, SQL, JavaScript, React/Redux. But you do need to write HTML/CSS in your final projects.- Pair programming: At first I was skeptical, but it turned out to be the best thing about aA. I learned so much from my coding pairs.The job search curriculum starts next week. So I don't know yet.Personal story: I considered switching my career path to coding in 2013. But I thought it's impossible with my liberal arts background. So I didn't give it too much thought and pursued another path. But inevitably I came back to coding. I started to code more in 2016 but still hesitated about whether to apply for developer jobs. When I finally made up my mind it was kind of late. But better late than never... I am grateful for being able to make that decision. No matter the results, had to try. I think you don't have to attend a bootcamp. Just don't give up easily. Try to learn programming for several months and see if you enjoy it. If not, that's fine. Even if you really want to be in the tech industry, there are options: many other roles like marketing/design are fun rewarding jobs too.Read Less",app-academy,10525

I wanted to wait until I actually got an offer, so here it is.If you're looking at this review, you're probably looking to make a career-change or gain an edge... Read More in landing that first software development role after graduating University (or High School?). For me, it was absolutely worth it.1. This is one of the only coding bootcamps which hold you to a certain learning-pace with weekly assessments for the first 8-ish weeks. If you fall behind and fail two of them, you're out of the program, and trust me this will take a lot of work to pass. It ensures that you actually learned the material and can do the basics, but the pace of this program isn't for everyone. You will wake up in the morning, get to the office, code all day, go home, work on HW assignments, code some more, sleep, then repeat for 3 months. You will literally live/eat/breathe code for the duration and you'll learn so much, but this brings up my second point.2. You will have no life during the program. When people say this in the reviews, they're not being excessive. I almost had a panic attack on the night before my first assessment (Sunday) because I was struggling with some concepts. You will learn a new concept and then be expected to pass an assessment on it the following week, while already learning new material. Tell your friends/girlfriend/family/dog that you'll pay attention to them after 3 months. (For reference, my cohort had like 20% of the cohort drop out... This isn't a joke)3. You will meet some of the most brilliant people you've ever met in your cohort. We've had Ivy-League grads, WallStreet guys, Entrepreneurs, Musicians, Basement gamers who want to finally get a job, etc... They were from all different backgrounds, but almost every single one of them were brilliant in their own way. I actually felt dumb for the first time in my life. Being surrounded by these people and pair-programming with each of them every single day will help you learn and see code in a different way. You'll also learn how to deal with not-so-favorable people, which will help you during your actual job (stubborn/argumentative people, keyboard hogs, etc), but these interactions are rare.4. The Job-Search support is actually one of the best parts of this curriculum. Technical and Non-Technical interviewing is a skill just like programming, and you'll gain a ton of practice white boarding and talking about yourself/background. My career coach was the best hype-man I could've ever asked for, and I think he actually helped me ultimately land my first role.If you put in the work, and you pass all the assessments, you'll land a job. A vast majority of my cohort all landed jobs within the first 6-months after program completion.The most important part is putting in the work after you actually finish the program (Job-Search is honestly the hardest part because there's minimal hand holding and you're actually competing for roles against other people who often have CS degrees). There's no time for an extended break after completing the program. Start working on more features on your fullstack project, start learning data structures / algorithms more in depth, white board at least once a week, etc... It will take a lot of work. The best part is that you have access to the office at all times, so you can go in to work while you look for a job even after you complete the program.For me, this program changed my life and I'm thankful I went through it.Lastly, I want to share one tip: Before you start the program, you absolutely should complete a beginner's web-development ""course"" on freecodecamp or Udemy.

My advice: take the practice assessments as many times as you can, and the chances of failing are much lower. I spent 10 months searching for a job. When I started my job search, my soft skills were weak, and my technical skills needed a lot of improvement. I practiced around 3 times a week doing practice interviews and white-boarding with my friends using Skype.

Like a year of college crammed into 3 months. While this is kind of true, I underestimated how much the family and community aspect of App Academy would help. There are weeks where you have to essentially code from morning until night with not much time for anything else. After you learn everything you need to build apps, you learn how to get a job. That entails applying to dozens of postings every week, and it could take months. Throughout this entire process, I felt like a freak, but had 70 friends right alongside doing it with me. They helped me when I was stuck, and more importantly, brought me up when I was down. I don't know if I could've ever pushed myself that hard to get a job on my own, but with my cohort, the process was streamlined and almost (dare I say it) fun.App Academy teaches a really diverse range of topics so the constant work you're doing is never boring. It's hardly even repetitive, and in fact, you will likely not fully understand most topics until you get to practice them again after the curriculum is over. In the end, App Academy didn't just teach me how to use React and Ruby on Rails. They taught me how to program, how to binge-learn any framework or language, how to speak to others in the field, and how to value myself, find a job, and negotiate as a Software Engineer. It was an absolute life changer in the best way. After going through it, I'm convinced anyone can do it, not just those technically inclined, and have been pushing the idea on all of my old friends who are stuck in a post-college rut with debts to pay.Summed up, if you're the type of person that looks at anything and wonders ""How does that work?"", then coding is for you.

Although the experience differs for each student, it typically involves submitting a coding challenge on a few common problems once you're ready. If you make through that part, you have to endure a technical interview where you cover a few more problems live over Skype followed by a non-technical interview to assess what makes you a candidate for their program.If accepted to the program, you go through an at-your-pace online alpha curriculum that covers the basics of programming before you start the bootcamp. The bootcamp covers three months of education: 8 weeks of the coding curriculum followed by 4 weeks of projects/job search curriculum. During the 8 weeks of coding curriculum, you will learning everything you need to know about the fullstack process from backend to frontend. Also, during these 8 weeks, you will be tested on your knowledge of the material every 1 to 1.5 weeks through an assessment. Failing two assessments will dismiss you from the program. Even the brightest of students fail an assessment. The assessments are there to help maintain the quality of students coming out of App Academy as well as provide structure for students.The structure is something you cannot get out of learning the material on your own. It forces students to learn the material as well as learn how to learn new material as technology changes in the job market. Every day, you go through a lecture in the morning starting at 8 AM followed by programming (usually paired) till 6 pm. Every night you will have readings and homework. During the day, App Academy has a strike system that ensures you are focused on learning, being present and doing your homework. This is also another area that can get students dismissed if they accrue enough strikes. Despite all these challenges, the time you have at App Academy will be among the best in your life. You will make great friends who will be your network entering the job market. The staff is also very dedicated to ensuring you succeed in the job market as an eventual software developer.

I came into the program with about a year of experience tinkering with Ruby, Javascript, and Python, and some background in logic, and a... Read More long history of playing around with computers, but no academic CS background. My academic background is in the humanities (philosophy and theology) and I spent the first six years after college in grad school, then teaching, then working at a small magazine. The course is extremely intense. (I say this as someone who graduated in the top 10% of my class at Yale.) About 25% of my cohort was asked to leave because they couldn't keep up with the pace. That said, the instructors do a good job of helping you through each day, and the structure of the course itself, from one day to the next, is very thoroughly regimented. If you do the course, I recommend surrendering to the routine as much as possible. There is always more work to do—you will almost never finish a day's projects. The name of the game is to struggle for 14+ hours, get some sleep, and then struggle again the next day. You will work on weekends, you will not have a day off before week ten (and if you think you do, you're probably making a mistake). If you can keep up, you will find that the rate of your learning is really high.A typical day goes as follows: you arrive at the office by ~8:45am in advance of the morning checkin and go to your assigned seat for the day, with your partner for the day. 9 - 9:30am is spent doing a CSS exercise. 9:30 to about noon is spent in lecture (lectures have built-in Q&amp;A time, and a five minute break in the middle). Lectures cover everything from O(n) and implementing backend Auth to meta-programming in Ruby and state structure design in Redux. Lectures are generally reinforcement of the essential concepts from the previous night's readings and homework. This means they tend to be more basic, and more Q&amp;A oriented than the readings—as a result they can feel boring if you understood the readings right away, but the reinforcement is essential. At 12:30 there's a lunch break, which continues until 1:45pm. Some people work on homework during lunch, but the instructors encourage students to take the time to have a break. At 1:45 there's another checkin, after which you resume work with your partner, starting the day's projects. There are usually two or three projects, the first one deals with implementing the concepts in the day's lecture, and then the subsequent projects tend to be more advanced extensions of the same material. You will rarely get through the second project of the day. Many days you won't even finish the first. At 6pm an instructor dismisses the class and makes any announcements or reminders. After 6pm about 1/4 of the cohort will stay behind to complete their homework at the office. Most people go home to do the homework, which is usually ~3 hours, depending on the number of recorded lecture segments and readings. After finishing the homework, students are expected to review the solutions to the day's projects, and read through the next day's project instructions in advance.That's life for the first 7 weeks of the course. Assessments are usually on Mondays or Wednesdays. They're terrifying, very difficult to prepare for, and intense, but if you do what the instructors tell you to do to study, and use the provided resources, the test itself should go fine. In the 8th week the typical lecture/project/homework schedule goes away and students spend about 10 days doing individual full-stake projects. This building a production-ready clone of a major web application (facebook, airbnb, etc.) from scratch, on your own. Project presentations happen at the end of week 9, after which the jobsearch curriculum begins. This is three weeks of lecture, independent projects, application/interview prep, etc. (That's where I'm at right now). If I remember, I'll come back and update this review once some time passes so I can assess the program in light of its key promise: to help you get an engineering job. As things stand, it could hardly have been better, except in minor ways here and there (a few unclear assignments, a few weak lectures), but as a learning experience it's up in the top experiences of my life.

In the weeks before my cohort started I read many of these reviews in search of clues that would help me know what to expect and how to succeed. Wondered... Read More if I would ever get the opportunity to write one. Promised myself that I would only contribute to the pile if I made it all the way through the final and ultimate challenge: getting a job.I start Monday, so here goes.App Academy is a fucking rollercoaster and during moments of frustration, satisfaction, hope, despair, pride, humility, fun, fatigue, laughter, and crying I often thought: “MY FINGER IS ON THE MEDIUM POST”. Okay, that was only for the bad times. For both the good and the bad the thought was: “this is going in the review”. I can’t recall all of what I intended to say during those moments now and a Knausgaard-esque stream-of-consciousness account of my App Academy experience is not what these review sites are for. So I will organize my thoughts into categories and bullet points for maximum skimability.GENERAL:- Yes, you do work the crazy hours they say you do. I generally went to bed around midnight and was up at 7 or 8AM. 85-95 hours a week is accurate.- No, they are not scared of kicking people out. My cohort lost like 20 or 25+%? It can be emotional losing people you befriended. It is depressing seeing people who worked hard have to leave. A lot of it can seem like chance. Anxiety, illness, fatigue, or just having a bad day can make the difference between a pass or a fail. Your best defense against any of these factors bringing you down is simply to study extremely hard for the tests.- Yes, there is a deposit they don’t tell you about. - No, App Academy is not a scam. GOOD:- The TAs. They are all intelligent, articulate, and helpful. You get assigned a TA as an advisor/mentor and mine was above-and-beyond supportive and awesome (shoutout to Anastassia).- The other students. App Academy attracts a smart bunch of people from all sorts of different backgrounds. Seriously, everyone is so smart. It’s easy to bond with people and make friends when you are all going through the same crazy experience.- The Ruby and Rails curriculum (first 4 weeks) is excellent.- For me the full-stack project was the highlight of App Academy. It’s rewarding to see everything you have learned come together to create something real. And it feels great to be able to make your own direction and have some creative freedom.- You learn React which is hot right now and a big asset when on the job search.- App Academy was my only option when it came to bootcamps for financial reasons. It sounds corny but it felt like someone believed in me and was willing to put money behind it. This was encouraging and motivating during the hard times.- Practicing interviewing during the job search helped my anxiety and performance during interviews.BAD:- The JavaScript curriculum is a dumpster fire. It's like a hastily-assembled Sunday night book report. Whoever made it seems to have Googled around for definitions of various JavaScript concepts then stitched them together into new documents so App Academy could say it had its OWN JavaScript curriculum. Had to unlearn and relearn lots of JS later on.- There’s something to be said for all-JS bootcamps like Hack Reactor if you want to be a front-end dev (like me). But I also appreciated learning programming fundamentals in a language like Ruby where I am purely focused on problem-solving.- The pace and the learning style is not for everyone. I do not learn best through lectures and it takes a little bit of time for new concepts to settle in. So I found myself writing TONS of notes during lectures and asking for one-on-one help from TAs or other students when I needed it.- Parts of the job search can be very one-size-fits-all. I get why it is this way and that there needs to be accountability but it could be frustrating.- Algorithms lectures at the end of the course feel like trying to cram 4 years of CS concepts into your brain in two weeks. Lots of room for improvement in the instruction and the structure.- Constant stress, feeling like the dumbest person on earth because you are around such smart people, beating up your body from long computer hours.- Tehama.TIPS:- DO THE PREP WORK. Do it twice. Study with other people before you start. You want to come into this strong and passing the first few assessments puts you in a far less stressful situation.- Do the practice assessments a million times. Especially if you are a slower or weaker student like me. Don’t slack on the weekend! If you drill hard all weekend you probably will not fail.- Sleep. Your brain needs it to work right.- Ask about deposit assistance if you cannot afford the full $5k deposit. There are some diversity scholarships and other ways you can work it out with them.- If you get the opportunity to do JumpStart for your admissions process I highly recommend it.Read Less",app-academy,10525

Prior to this class the only coding experience I had was from an Intro to Programming college class 6 years ago.COURSE PACE / MATERIALCompared to a 3 month... Read More Introductory to Programming class offered at a college, this is a one month course. But you’ll learn more in the one month than an entire semester in a traditional college setting. The class meets for two and a half hours a day, five days a week for four weeks. Expect to start the first day with a two and half hour lecture. Overall the course was very well paced and clearly delivers coding foundations and basics. I made the mistake of falling behind which led the first two weeks being very challenging. Assignments are given out every day so prepare to spend extra time outside of class (1 to 2hrs/day) coding and learning. Lesson notes are provided as text as well as video walk through which was VERY helpful. You can also ask the instructors for help if needed, they were always available after class. As far as learning enough to get accepted into a top bootcamp: the class offers a money back guaranteed so you really can’t lose out. I do feel that graduated who spend time practicing after the course will have a very good shot at making it into top bootcamps. INSTRUCTORS / NON-TECHNICAL BENEFITSThis was what made the class worth it for me. Usually when you talk to someone (especially an instructor that works for a bootcamp) you’ll notice they’re trying to sell you something. That wasn’t the case here. I had a TON of questions about working in coding, surviving the 100hour/week main bootcamp, what the job market was like for graduates of a full time bootcamp, what can cause someone to fail, etc.. The Bootcamp Prep instructors (Alvin and David) were very honest and accommodating.For the first time I felt like I was getting real and genuine answers. Alvin and David were very patient and didn’t sugar coat anything. The info they gave really helped solidify my desire to go into software engineering and allowed me to plan and prepare accordingly to attend a full time bootcamp in the future.

For the first 8 weeks, you are going to be going to a/A and getting a lecture in the morning and then coding until 5:30PM with some exceptions. After that, you will have homework, which includes assignments, readings, videos, which generally take about 1-3 hours in the earlier weeks and going up to 5 hours as you progress through the course.You spend your first 2-3 weeks, going over Ruby to practice/learn coding fundamentals. The next 3 weeks are spent learning SQL and Ruby on Rails, where you can create your first website! After creating your website, you learn JavaScript for about a week and then React/Redux to learn how to improve your website. I honestly wish more time was spent on the JavaScript portion of the curriculum, but at this point everything is moving along even faster. You spend weeks 8-9 creating a clone of a website like Instagram, SoundCloud, Facebook ect. This is probably the first time where you are actually building a project from scratch to finish and its great once you accomplished it! However up until you finish, it will most likely be a struggle and a big learning experience.After that is done, you get to move to the job search portion, where you build another solo project and a group project of your choice, which was also pretty fun/struggle!

After that you have around two weeks to work on learning algorithms, which are key to getting a job. You pretty much self learn/have limited help during this time and you basically set your own schedule more or less.Overall App Academy is great for getting introducing you to being a software developer.

But that’s what a bootcamp is meant to do. Sleepless nights, hours of homework reading and problems (after 9 hours of coding), and weekly assessments will push you to your mental and physical limits. You will experience moments where the last thing you want to do is write another line of code, or spend another hour trying to debug your program. The most important thing is to keep on trying, and ask for help when you need it. The support system is there for you to take advantage of, and everyone is happy to help.But it’s not all bad.

For as much stress and frustration you will go through, you will experience twice the amount of achievement, learning, and moments of triumph.

I'll just talk about the experience I have to this point. The way the curriculum works is that you have 9 weeks of the learning curriculum. You learn Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React,... Read More Redux, SQL, and more. You also create your full-stack project.The next 3 weeks is the career curriculum. Here they teach you what you need to do to get a job, and what you should expect. During this time, you create a javascript project.First off let me say, it is a difficult program. When they say 100 hours/week, it's literally 100 hours per week. It is a pretty hard thing to get used to. Also, during the first 9 weeks, there are 6 assessments that you have to pass. If you don't pass 2, your out. So kind of harsh. However, at the end of it, it's a really accomplished feeling.I would recommend planning on not having a life for the 3 months you are in the program.

561,244576,1,Software Engineering,2018.0,1,,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"App Academy is an incredibly rewarding experience — I've been attending the program in SF for 9 weeks, and just finished the first section of the course, and I can't even describe how much I've enjoyed it. We've learned Ruby, SQL, Javascript, React, Redux,... Read More Rails, and completed a full-stack clone of an existing application. There are people of all ages and backgrounds here. The youngest being 17 (by a pretty wide margin), and the oldest 40+. There are quite a few CS majors, but also people with engineering, accounting, sales, etc. backgrounds. However, the gender ratio for this cohort was pretty bad: about 1/12 are female. There are definitely people who are a lot better at coding from the start than others, which may change over the course of the program, so be prepared for that.In my opinion, these are the two most incredible parts of a/A:1. How much you learn, and how fast you learn it. The workload is intense (see below), but you'll amaze yourself with how capable you are of absorbing it! 2. The people. The TA's are very intelligent and genuinely want to help you succeed. The culture is not competitive at all. Everyone supports each other. We help one another with bugs, explain concepts to those who are struggling, get lunch together, and generally have a good time while coding. This community is actually very important, especially considering that we spend at least 45 hours together/week.When you apply and pass the interviewing process, you must complete an Alpha Course — essentially a pretty packed curriculum on the basics of Ruby and Object Oriented Programming. a/A recommends that you spend 4 weeks on this, which is definitely a good idea. However, completely it in less than that time is doable if you can fully commit all your time to doing it. I finished in less than 2 weeks, although I had some prior programming experience in Java. I also spent nearly the entirety of every day working on it. Each day during the first section of the actual course looked pretty much the same, save the material we learned that day: 9am start, lecture for around 2 hours, then pair program for the rest of the day to practice the material taught in lecture, with a break for lunch and a brief one in the afternoon. After the school day is over, we do 1-3 hours of homework. The homework consists of readings/videos and a small assignment that cover the material for the next day, which will be reviewed during the lecture. This is why a/A is definitely a full-time commitment — really try to keep up, and this is totally doable if you are sufficiently motivated and allocate your time wisely. At first, it was pretty difficult to adjust to this schedule: my eyes would be really sore by Thursday of each week for the first 3 weeks, and there are no windows so it's a little stifling. However, by the end of that, I was fully adapted.There are a total of 6 assessments spread across the first 8 weeks, and if you fail twice, and then fail a retake, you are kicked out, no exceptions. This is a really strict policy, and it's definitely a lot of pressure. About 25% of the people in my cohort were kicked out, so please consider this carefully. I failed the third assessment, and was really stressed for the rest, but passed them without a problem. These assessments really are not designed to get you or anything like that. They provide practice assessments, and as long as you do those until you can finish it in about half the time you get for the real assessment, you will be totally fine. Just make sure you understand the material — don't simply memorize! Overall, an amazing experience, and I would definitely do it again given the choice.Read Less",app-academy,10525

Chris Pine’s Intro to Ruby free online course helped me a lot in that regard, you can google it but I believe App Academy should have also linked you to that resource. The program is intense, even for people with cs degrees. People with background will definitely catch up concepts faster and some will be a review for them. But it doesn't mean its not hard for them. As a someone without tech background, came to aA everyday including weekends to study. They are not lying about 100 hours per week of studing time. for the first 9 weeks, I've never slept more than 6 hours.

Teaching competency of instructors varies – some are excellent, some are mediocre – but honestly it's probably as good as you can expect from any coding bootcamp. Instructor support overall is very good. Everything you need for a solid foundation to begin the cohort is provided throughout the application process; what's key is setting aside enough time to properly absorb the material (at least two months prior to interviewing, a month between the first and last interview, and a month between admission and cohort start time). The provided prep material is time intensive in its own right, and most who struggle to keep up didn't spend enough time preparing. Time to catch up after beginning the cohort is almost non-existent. What makes aA stand out: - Rigid structure of accountability through roll calls, assignments, and assessments. Like having a good physical trainer, you may often hate the diet and the workouts in the moment, but in the long run you'll be surprised how much you progress.  - Constant pair programming and collaborative work. Especially taxing for introverts, but enormously helpful in learning how to communicate effectively. A significant advantage over solo/remote study options, and even most university curricula. - Outstanding job search curriculum. Lots of very helpful workshops, application prep, and interview practice. Can you learn everything taught in a bootcamp on your own? Almost certainly. What you're paying for is the opportunity to learn it faster, make connections with other students/instructors, and receive solid career coaching. Most motivated individuals would still take at least two to three times longer to cover the same amount of material, if studying full time.

Going into the 10-week course, I had been dabbling in programming languages as a hobby for several months prior.... Read More I had begun to consider web development as a career, but was becoming quite lost and overwhelmed in my attempts to educate myself, despite the vast amount of online resources. I realized that if I wanted to take web dev seriously, I would learn best in a classroom setting with industry professionals, and BrainStation certainly met my expectations.I spent several weeks researching the different coding ""bootcamps"" around Toronto, before ultimately deciding on BrainStation. After expressing interest through the BrainStation website, a learning advisor very quickly reached out to me by phone, and answered every and any question I had about the course. That, and the combination of a beautiful, centrally located campus with ample amenities, to the professional and prompt communication between myself and the campus staff, I knew I was making a good decision. Going into the course I knew the basics of HTML and CSS, which are the two programming languages the course covers, but the course is designed for people who are absolute beginners and know nothing about web development. I still think that if you are familiar with the basics of web development, you would still benefit from the course as the foundational concepts of HTML and CSS are taught in a very approachable way and I found it to be a good refresher for myself before moving onto the more advanced concepts. The class was relatively small, about 20 people or so, and as a result we had a lot of opportunity to ask questions and seek help. Our instructor, Dan, and our TA, Ishan, were absolutely amazing. Dan is clearly an experienced professional in the industry, and explained and showed us concepts in a really thoughtful way and at no point did I feel overwhelmed by the content. He was quick to explain why each thing we were learning was relevant, and I did not feel that we were being taught any ""fluff"" content or things that weren't relevant to my learning goals. Ultimately, I went from knowing the bare minimum about web development, to being able to make a website that not only worked, but also looked good. I felt very accomplished by what I was able to do by the end of the course and I feel confident in saying that taking this course is one of the best, if not the absolute best way to get your foot in the door for a career in web development, or if you are just looking to expand your skills portfolio or simply to learn something new.

These sessions are hands down the best part about the course; anyone can just find a variety of content about UX online and teach themself how to design, but the mentor helps validate a lot of that learning and encourages you as you go. The content of the course is an amalgamation of various sources online about UX design, from Lynda courses to Skillshare to articles on Medium and other sites. The quality of the materials tends to be great, though there are a few pieces that I skipped over.

Then, either before or after lunch, start your pair programming projects, where you are matched with a new person every day to work on a project that covers from the basics to very complex problems about the topic you just learned in lecture. Every day there are 3 things expected of you that will prepare you for the project that day- 1) you watch the lecture videos/do the readings on the topic they will be teaching the next day, 2) you do the homework to the best of your ability, to familiarize yourself with the topic, and 3) if you have any time left, you review the previous day's project to expose yourself to any topics you may not have gotten to in class. You are exposed to the topics you learn 3-4 times, like the readings, homework, lecture, and daily projects, and so although the pace is fast, you pick up on them soon just by repeated exposure. There are also so many opportunities to ask questions, and the TAs are so helpful and dedicated and will spend huge amounts of time making sure you really solidly understand a topic. My advice is to ask as many questions as you can until you can fully explain the topic to somebody else, and to accept that for 3 months this will be your life. In the end, you really are equipped with the skills to be a great web developer.Read Less",app-academy,10525

My student advisor, Dave, was kind enough to help me determine how to reach my personal goal and spend what I could afford.Although there is no job guarantee (apparently, a ""UX Career Track"" course was recently added for this purpose), the UX Design course helped me learn new skills and flesh out my existing portfolio. A lot of UX job ads specify that a UI background and/or HTML and CSS skills are required, which are areas where I currently lack proficiency. I'm hoping I'll eventually be able to get a stable UX job (perhaps after acquiring more technical knowledge) or apply my skill set to a similar field.To summarize, I highly recommend Springboard if you want to understand the UX process as a whole, though you will benefit further if you already have front-end development experience.Read Less",springboard,11035

Springboard seriously prepared me for the interview process even though I was no where near the career prep section of the course (that's module 14).However, everything I learned up until section 8 helped me through the interview process, and Springboard's articles on Medium about preparing for interviews was also a life saver. The course in combination with the articles taught me how to explain my work and discuss the typical UX design process, since I had experience with that through the course.I was interview around 4 times, with different members of the team/recruiters which included an in person interview and I also had to do a design challenge which I was very nervous about but I took everything I learned so far in Springboard and applied it to the challenge. I'm happy to share that I got the job and have working there for 3 months (since January), but I decided to still continue with Springboard and I completed the course the end of February 2019.I would definitely recommend Springboard to those who already have a design background and are looking to gain more experience in the research aspect of UX Design. Even those who have a research background such as Psychologists, Communication/Marketing (I have a BA in Communication) majors will also find the course helpful if they're looking to transition into UX, however, the UI Design section isn't as thorough in this course like in the UX Career Track, as this course is only 3-4 months long.If you're looking for a course that goes more in depth when it comes to UI design, the UX Design Career Track for Springboard might be a better option. That course is 6 months long with career coaching and a job guarantee, but the application process is much more extensive and the price is higher. You also have to have a previous design background to gain entry into that course so the UX Design course that I took might get your foot in the door.Overall, I'm grateful for Springboard and all they have to offer. I highly recommend them!Note: The course I took was originally a Skills Track called UX Design when I was enrolled, but it's now called UX Essentials.Read Less",springboard,11035

It was an amazing experience which turned me to a designer as I wished. I’m now a UI/UX designer in a development agency and having fun. I got the job offer in week 9... Read More - big shoutout to my instructor Brad who helped me with the performance check during the interview process as well as my TA Uzair who helped refurbish my resume and cover letter completely.A bit of my background: Before joining the program, I was working as a 3D artist in a VR studio, then quit coz it’s crap. Then I was home tutoring high-school kids for half a year, then stopped coz it’s frustrating (I was making good money out of it but not my thing). I wanted to be a designer doing some cool shit, but never had a job opportunity to get started. I sent my resume and portfolio to a bunch of companies in Vancouver, got responses, got tests, got interviews, but never got the position. I realized leaving the industry for a couple of months (when I was tutoring) made my sense dull and skills rusty - I need a place where I could sharpen everything again and get my thunder back. I’m gonna share some reasons I joined BrainStation and how the results ended up. If you have a similar situation and consider whether to join the program or not, my story may help you.I’m a layman. I need a place to teach me both practices and theories. I tried counting on myself to learn the skillset and toolkit of UX design, but it was frustrating coz I literally didn’t know where to start! To learn software first? Or read books? Or do a small project? UX is such a giant shit blackhole and could almost suck everything in: business analysis, research, information architecture, UI design, interaction design, visual design, content writing, or even front-end if you wanna be entitled as ‘full-stack designer’ (fascinating) - whatever you can possibly associate with product development. Yeah UX design is such a sugarcoated beast, sounds high-end, easy-going, user-friendly, but in reality quite intimidating and could bite your head off - if you dive in blindly without fair guidance. As a 3D modeler before, I did know Adobe Suite, but in terms of the current tools of UI/UX design such as Sketch, InVision, Principle, etc., I’m a total outsider. Fortunately, during the pre-course, I learned the essentials of Sketch and InVision from the step-by-step tutorials; then throughout the next 10 weeks, I was improving my hard skills considerably by working on the weekly homework and capstone project. The instructor and TA would teach us tips every now and then to quicken our speed of work. As for theories, I did know user-centered design and some relevant approaches such as user stories, usability testing, but they were too scattered in my mind and never systematically came into shape as a ‘UX tree’ or ‘UX umbrella’. What BrainStation does is breaking down the whole UX topic to 10 smaller ones - each topic per week. Each week we focused on one topic and did homework around it to deepen our understanding. Meanwhile, we could update our capstone project by adopting the new stuff learned this week. The weekly basis is fast indeed, even crazy (using one week to investigate UI design, are you kidding, that’s even a job title!), but come on, this is a bootcamp and we only have 10 weeks. This curriculum is brilliant in my opinion (and PPT is well-done): it takes care of all epics of UX design such as research, IA, UI design, etc. - which should be mastered more or less as a UX-er; but in reality, we could (and should) leverage our advantages and choose to specialize in one or a few directions. Taking myself as an example, I’m more interested and better at visual stuff than research, IA or business whatever, so I actually put more weight on the chapters of UI and visual design but honestly much less on certain sections (I got 55/100 once in one of my assignments, shame… ). I’m lazy. Yes if nobody pulls me up, I could stay in bed for whole day. I tried saving money and studied on my own - and wonderfully, I slept in till 11 am, opened my laptop reluctantly, and lost morale in one hour. You know what’s so good after I joined the program? I COULDN’T SLACK OFF! Yeah I was busy like shit: class from 9 to 5, homework stacking up, capstone project crying for feed, workshops awaiting, portfolio pending - gosh, don’t ever underestimate ‘FULL-TIME’ training (this is not a joke). Frankly, the workload is immense - I was working in the evening, during the weekend, sometimes burning night oil. It’s not only because I myself wanted to work harder, but once I saw my classmates working their asses off, how could I sit still and enjoy the couch potato time? Most importantly, we paid to learn, so the only way not wasting the money is - work hard!! It’s painstaking, but it will pay off. Everyone in my cohort was progressing so much - I’ve seen people who made stunning interfaces in the end even having zero design background at the very beginning. I’m an introvert. I bet you all know socializing is as important as swimming when you’re in the job-hunting vortex. Sadly, I’m afraid of socializing and terrible at selling stuff. ESL is a reason but it’s more about my personality. I desperately needed a community at that moment where I could find a comfort zone with like-minded people. And yes BrainStation is like that for me. Amazingly, our cohort had 12 folks, and we teamed up differently for multiple projects, so everyone had a chance to work with each other. Every Friday, we went to a bar to grab beers after class. At the night of graduation, we barbecued and sang karaoke like a bunch of weirdos! People are professional at school but could be so wild afterward! The instructors are also super approaching (yeah they joined our beer too) and other staff are quite helpful (just ask them if you need a favor.) Besides, we have tech-talks, workshops, and presentations every week, so don’t worry, you’ll be pushed under the spotlight and try your best to entertain the audience! In summary, if you’re like me, not good at networking, then at least you will have your cohort and the staff, which will become your own community and, it’s still growing. Last but not least, I bet the tuition is a big concern to most of us and I admit it’s not a small amount indeed. I was jobless and broke from the moment I gave up on tutoring, so yeah I thought about this a lot. So I tried two options to make it less unaffordable: firstly, applying for the scholarship. Do ask the staff what kind of scholarship you are eligible for; secondly, there’s an installment option to pay off the debt in 12 months (and I chose this). Good news is you can use the tuition for tax return, yeah! And once you land on a new job after graduation, I suppose you won’t mind this educational investment. (The common salary of junior UI/UX designer in BC is 40k-50k)In conclusion, this was my happiest training experience, maybe because I finally found what I like to do. I hope my story could help you in any way. Good luck and keep it up!Read Less",brainstation,10571

I have kids and a full-time freelance job so the program took longer for me, but I will tell anyone who listens that it was absolutely worth it.Read Less",springboard,11035

732,247580,0,,2019.0,1,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Recently finished up the 10-week part-time digital marketing course at Brainstation's Toronto location from January to March 2019, on Mondays from 6:30 pm to 9:30 pm.I currently work full-time in the hospitality industry however have a bachelor's degree... Read More in Marketing and Communications and am looking to pursue an opportunity in digital marketing and advertising. I have worked in the industry before as a content creator and social media manager, but up until now all of my digital marketing techniques have been self taught which is why I chose to enroll in my first Brainstation course.My favourite thing about the part-time digital marketing course is that it is not too intensive... if you approach it the right way. Review the course content each week before class, complete your homework and you will be fine. Every week is focused on a different digital marketing technique and then you are sent home with a mini assignment that is extremely relevant to the final project (which is a hypothetical digital marketing campaign). Completing these assignments allows you to chisel away at the final project, week by week.The course instructors contributed to my overall experience as well. Both Jenna Kellner and Hailey Smith are extremely knowledgeable and have a lot of experience in the digital marketing industry. Their own expertise combined with the course content made it extremely easy to grasp each weekly concept. They also stuck around after class each week to answer any questions which was extremely helpful.As mentioned earlier, the course curriculum revolves around different digital marketing techniques including content &amp; SEO, paid advertising &amp; SEM, analytics and measurements, social media management, paid social media advertising and e-mail marketing. These techniques were extremely helpful as it is information that is not traditionally taught in university. I find that a university degree paired with a couple Brainstation certificates is what will set you up for success in the industry that you're looking to grow in or break into.Although I've only been done my course for a couple weeks, I've noticed that being associated with the Brainstation brand has already increased my value to potential employers. I'm currently interviewing at a firm and the opportunity arose because the hiring manager knew about Brainstation and was impressed with my enrollment in the digital marketing course. Furthermore, I feel like being in the Brainstation network is extremely beneficial as you are introduced to so many students and industry professionals who are always available for guidance and even collaboration.In conclusion, I recommend this course for anyone who is looking for an intro into the digital marketing industry. Thankfully, Brainstation offers more tailored courses if you're looking to master the techniques introduced in this course. A couple things that I would recommend to anyone looking to enroll:1) Be prepared to use Slack as your main method of communication with students and instructors. It can be a bit confusing at first.2) Don't skip class unless you really have to. Everything is covered in the slides however instructors provide a lot of personal insight that is very useful.3) The final project is completed in groups. Don't be alarmed if some group members don't pull their weight. Use it as an opportunity to master your craft instead.Read Less",brainstation,10571

Upon graduating Brainstation after my 12 weeks, I have to say that it exceeded my expectations in all of these realms.The instructors have seemingly unlimited patients and an incredible empathy that allows you to push yourself through this tough 12 weeks.

While the job I got was not directly in Software Development, it has helped me join a great company with a clear path towards achieving that goal.

It introduced me to the tech industry in such a fantastic way. I hit the ground running and have been set on an incredibly positive trajectory of which I never before thought possible.A bit of background... Read More on me: I took the full time User Experience Design Course at BrainStation Vancouver back in June 2018. Leading up to the course I was working as a photographer, lost at where my career was heading and flirting with the idea of moving into the tech industry. I wanted to stay creative so UX seemed a logical option and the appeal of launching a new career from a fast paced bootcamp was huge. Too good to be true surely? For traditional teaching methods, sure. For the educational wizards at BrainStation, no they’ve got it nailed. The moment I first walked into BrainStation I knew it was the place for me - I attended their intro to UX workshop which helped me understand what UX was and if it would be something of interest to me. I also experiencing a Demo Day to see how previous students managed (highly recommend!) and seeing what is possible in 10 weeks was astounding. The professional nature of the students, educators and environment helped me confirm my decision that BrainStation was the one.So I started the course. I had no prior design experience and we didn’t ease into things, diving into the deep end on the first week with a design sprint. Incredibly challenging, incredibly rewarding the growth and progress I saw in a week 1 was noticeable. This continued week on week, with the syllabus combining learning new material in lectures and applying it immediately in design challenges and week long projects. Oh and we were introduced to the mother of all projects - Capstone. Capstone would be the pinnacle of all we learnt during the course, allowing us to show future employers what we’re capable of. During the 10 weeks I felt myself moving from sketching anxiety to being confident in calling myself a designer. The course content has clearly been iterated upon multiple times to give students the perfect platform for a successful career in UX, whether it’s hard or soft skills for post bootcamp life and this really shows. In summary the full time UX programme at BrainStation has prepared me incredibly well for real life UX work. I feel like I even have more current UX knowledge than some of my now colleagues that have been in the industry for years. The people of BrainStation are the main reason for making the whole experience so memorable. They exude positivity and do everything in their power to get you on the best track possible. I was fortunate enough to have Brad and Uzi as my educators and they really are perfect examples of an educator, tech or otherwise. Their enthusiasm is infectious and they were so knowledgeable and supportive during the entire experience. The post course support is also great and the team is always there to help with any queries in the period after - shout out to Teddy for that one! So where am I now? Since finishing the course I moved back to the UK and I set about building my portfolio and getting my first UX role. 2 months after the course finished I landed my first role in a tech startup and I now have 6 months of experience. A rapid transformation especially compared to traditional education methods. A role won’t fall into your lap though - listen hard and do everything you can during the course and after to make yourself employable as possible. It’s not an easy role to break into with a lot of juniors out there looking for first jobs so do everything to make yourself stand out.I haven’t gone into specifics too much in this review, so please reach out to me on LinkedIn if you have any questions regarding anything BrainStation or UX and I’d be more than happy to help.Pro tip: don’t overthink Demo Day.

It is absolutely in that ballpark. Of course, it's different for everyone and some topics will come easier to some folks. I didn't find that I was spending 90 hours every single week, but the time really begins to add up quickly between the 45-minute commute there, morning lecture time from 9 AM - 12:15 PM, afternoon pair programming from 1:30 PM to 6 PM, another 45-minute commute home, and then any required readings, videos, and homework for the following day's material which could often take up to 3 or 4 hours. All of that happens 5 days a week, with no holidays or time off. It also wasn't completely unheard of for members of my cohort to be in about an hour early or to work through lunch in order to solidify some of the concepts.I can say that I WAS able to carve out a little time on the weekends to maintain my sanity, but for at least the first half of the curriculum (when assessments are on Mondays) every minute you spend on the weekend not studying is just going to fill you with a combination of guilt and dread on top of the stress already placed on you by the rigor of the course. As other reviews have mentioned, the assessments are not easy but they are always very fair. It is definitely not subjective in any way and assessments are graded solely based on how many test specs you can get to pass before time runs out. The quantity of material you need to know for any individual test is large and studying will sometimes feel insurmountable. However, it is absolutely possible for every person in the cohort to get a perfect score since the tests are not designed to trick you or test you on something you weren't explicitly told to study for.Anyone who isn't scared off by the absolutely massive scale of the curriculum and the short timeframe you're afforded to cram it all into your brain in a useable way will be rewarded with an incredible toolkit and the confidence to apply for any software developer job. I'm in the middle of my job search currently and I'm applying to tons of stuff, including and especially jobs that work on a different stack than App Academy teaches, strictly because I am now confident that there is nothing I can't teach myself using the skills I gained at a/A.Lastly, I can't say enough good things about the Teaching Assistants at a/A. They are super knowledgeable, great at debugging (as they likely see similar issues from cohort to cohort), and are genuinely invested in your success. I asked for help often and was never made to feel inferior or bad about it in any way. I expect that the curriculum may change as long as new languages, frameworks, and technologies are always popping up in the tech world.

Read More up web development without much coding background, but I think the program does a good job at teaching you what to focus on. The most intensive part of the curriculum is keeping up with the schedule. The material by itself is structured to teach a student from the ground up. The challenging portion is for the student to maintain studying priorities, time management, and health. If a student can do these things well, then the student will be able to pick up everything needed to pass the program. The job search support is very good. I feel like App Academy is set up for a student's success, giving the student constant support and material to work on post-graduation from the program.

After digging around, I decided to join Springboard's (SB) UX Career Track because with the job guarantee in place and affordable tuition, I felt reassured that it would... Read More be the quickest and efficient means to get into a new industry. Now that I'm done, I believe this was one of the wisest decisions I've made. What I liked the most about SB is that it is designed to be very resource-conscious, and even though they are an online program, you actually get a lot of one-to-one/real-life interaction. They are genuinely invested in your learning and success, and everyone I've engaged with through the SB network—from the administrative staff to mentors to fellow coursemates—are really smart and supportive individuals. You don't get the impression that they are just ""running a business"" or scheming to milk your every dime. The entire experience was very human.The curriculum is also very thoughtfully designed. Even though at first I thought the idea of ""curated content"" rather than ""original content"" may be a downside, I have come to appreciate it. Because we are reading materials written by multiple people on similar subject matters, I have a better feel of the overall disciplinary discussions out there, and I feel like the knowledge is something I could confidently fall back on.Even though this is an online/remote program, I am glad to see that over time SB is investing in more in-person activities and interactions, such as onsite community events. One of the three projects we had to complete was an industry design project (IDP) where we get paired with a start-up to do real client work. My student advisor, Dave Weiner (Hi Dave...), thoughtfully paired me up with a company that works with education, since I came from academia myself. The office of the start-up was also located really close to where I live, so I actually got to visit the office and meet the team in real life. Because of this human thoughtfulness, the whole internship experience unfolded much more smoothly and successfully, and in the end, I got hired back as full-time staff without having to go through endless rounds of resume (re)writing, etc.The fact that the industry project turned into a real full-time position really helped me get the foot in the door (which is the hardest step really), so I don't take it lightly. But even without that luck, I do believe that in the current product job market, having real work experience is more important than learning of any shape and form, so having the IDP as one of the units was a huge advantage. Hopefully, SB will continue to invest in the IDP/internship program and expand their professional network, so that more students can continue to benefit.Read Less",springboard,11035

Read More I don’t know why they say that but it’s probably rooted at the top level. This is what you need to know.To get into App Academy it will be pretty hard to just apply and pray...you need to Study. If you do study than look for the app academy problems online or go on GitHub(entry level) and search for them. Jumpstart can help if your background is weak(only couple months), but I certainly noticed an edge for those who did Boot Camp Prep(I didn’t and I was a little envious). So who Am I ? Well I just graduated Today...take my review with respect to that aspect of App Academy’s curriculum. Reviewing them is a little tough because everyone is different, some people pick it up faster(I’m diligent so it’s at what I call a normal pace) and others pick it up faster, but those people which will be in Your cohort have some type of strong technical background most likely. The tests are hard and it is true you can’t tell which one is the hardest normally due to the differences in people. They will overwork you on purpose and try to see if you can pass because if you can’t they want you to fail out. Part of the reason is the last ten days of the main part of the curriculum they let you work on the full stack, but it’s an extremely expensive operation and probably not profitable for them if you can’t do the basics of coding. Not to mention once you start the Full Stack project you need to be able to do it mostly on your own so you can put it on your Resume and say “I did that.” The best part? The Teacher assistants without a doubt. I was actually surprised at home many there are(around six plus the main instructor). The teacher assistants are highly skilled and during the course you will likely learn the most from them more than anything else. When you put it all together App Academy’s program is very good and costs quite a bit of capital to run, remember these teacher assistants are paid well. A couple of last notes. They are now like a well oiled machine. They hire in advance, train the next leaders before they leave, prep the next cohort as soon as you start yours, and they do not stop for whatever reason.....in App academy there are no days off and they work through almost all holidays. If you want to go to App Academy I recommend it. Better if you can pair it with a degree, but standalone it’s good too. If I was you and you were accepted I would not hangout on the weekends. I went to a wedding one day and felt behind the entire course because of it. There’s so much homework that catching up is really hard and the weekends are for studying the tests since it’s pointless to do the homework if you can’t pass the test. Overall four stars because of the lack of support for stressed out individuals. They say talk to us, but it’s not very inviting and I took it as a clue for an opportunity for them to say to you “this course is not for everyone.”Read Less",app-academy,10525

Every week I have answered 10/10, and I still would.I came to aA after having... Read More studied CS formally, as well as having a lot of experienceworking as a developer in the past, just looking to reskill to keep up with theindustry. This is not the story for most students, and you certainly don't need prior experience to succeed, although you will probably have to put in more effort before-hand to ensure you understand the basics.AA is as difficult as everyone says. I have probably spent 100-120 hours workingon material every week since the program started to keep up with the readings.Expect to spend every waking minute once you start doing nothing but studying or coding. Your life will be AA; it is a bootcamp after all. No nights, no weekends,no holidays (we were expected to come in Memorial day).You will come out of this knowing how to develop a full stack application, as wellas have a portfolio of several projects to show an employer. You will learn a fewbasic CS concepts (a very small introduction to DS/A), but without college experienceyou will probably need to spend a bit of time doing additional independent studyafter the cohort, during interview prep. Compared to a college degree where you willlearn more of the academic CS concepts, but have a lot less to actually show.You will also get through this much faster, and cheaper, than going for a four year degree.I personally feel that actually being able to build a real app, something a lot of collegecurricula spend too little time focusing on, is a huge advantage over traditional study.There are a few negatives. Most of the project work you complete before your fullstackproject will not actually be usable for portfolios, although it will teach you a lot.You will not always get a good pair, although almost everyone you work with will becomeyour closest friends for the next 12 weeks. There are also some policies that could usesome reworking. Prior to my application, it was not clear that the program also had apreliminary ""foundations"" course, four weeks of self directed study to prep for theprogram (which you absolutely need to do if you don't have experience!! make sure youare comfortable with this material on day 1 of in person), and this could have been made more transparent prior to applying. Some of the material is a bit outdated, whichis expected given how fast technologies evolve and new versions come out. The curricula is constantly under development, but some aspects may lag slightly behind.I still say, given the choice between this and a CS degree, this will be more useful toyou practically, as you will actually be building real applications in what is equivalentto less than a semester of college. AA is extremely prestigious, and I would not havedecided to come here if I wasn't going to be proud to include it on my Resume.Read Less",app-academy,10525

829,253078,0,Software Engineering,2019.0,1,,Software Engineer Track: In-Person,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Before deciding to attend a bootcamp, I did the same thing you are doing. I read review after review, trying to gauge the value a program like this one might offer me. My previous experience with coding was a grand total of one Intro to C++ class at a... Read More local community college, and a few of UC Berkeley's online Software Development Certificate classes (none of which I personally recommend, but that's a story for another day). Once I had decided that the bootcamp path was one I would take, I began the arduous task of selecting the RIGHT bootcamp. Ultimately, I decided that an in-person program was the right fit for my learning style. Living in the SF Bay Area, there seemed to be two choices. I asked friends and family, that work in the tech industry, to take a look at the syllabi, read all the reviews, and had a few sleepless nights. I ultimately chose App Academy as the school I wanted to attend, participated in their online bootcamp prep program, and a few months later I was rewarded with acceptance into their program. Then the really difficult part began . . .  This program is intense, it's designed that way and they make no apologies about it. You are forced to constantly learn new material, never truly feeling comfortable before the next topic is laid before you. A week into the course, I was sure that I would not make it. I came home everyday to my wife and told her that I had no idea what was going on, that I was barely hanging on, that many other people surely had a better grasp of the material and I was doomed. I spent hours each day after class and every weekend up at the school, working on homework or studying for assessments. App Academy is quick to point out that almost everyone has these feelings, and it's Imposter Syndrome in full effect. They chose you for a reason, they say. You are supposed to be here. For myself, these feelings of inadequacy continued through the course. Though you do get comfortable with a general feeling of unease and helplessness. I will also say, that despite these feelings, I did feel supported throughout the program. I could ask questions whenever I wanted, help was available from TAs and my fellow students. The bonds formed in this stressful situation, and the assistance that you are able to both receive and give to those around you helps keep you grounded and headed towards the finish line. I've heard a lot of talk about the structure of Assessments, and the policy of being asked to leave if you fail 2 of them. Is the system perfect? No, it is not. Is fear an amazing motivator? Yes, it certainly is. Is watching good, hardworking, smart people walk out the doors early a painful experience? Without a doubt. Is there a better way to do it? I truly don't know. But that is the process that App Academy has chosen, so just know what you are getting into. If you are not able to calm yourself down in extremely stressful testing situations, these tests are going to be hard. But, if you do the work, if you go over the practice tests and make attempts to understand the material to the best of your ability, if you are honest with yourself about the information you do not understand and ask questions, you will be fine. If I made it through, you can too. As I write this, I am at the end of the program, with just a few days left. The Job Search part of the program is much different than the instructional portion. There is much less structure, the occasional lecture on soft skills, networking, reumés, interviewing questions, and further work on some algorithms and data structures. Some people enjoy this portion, some hate it. Some feel abandoned, some use it to finally focus on what they really find interesting. I don't really have any issues with it. I'm happy to be provided with the school's perspective on how to get a job in a very competitive industry, but the quick switch from an extremely structured environment to one where you drive the process can have one feeling lonely. In the end though, you are the only one responsible for your career and you have to start providing yourself with motivation and guidance at some point in time. Overall, I can honestly say that I would make the decision to come back to App Academy again. I have learned invaluable skills, and I have a path to a job doing something that I love. There is still a lot of work left to do. I will have to go back and dive deeper into nearly all of the concepts covered in the course. I don't believe that most people come out able to get a job the next day, but I would never have made the progress that I did without the rigor and stress that came along with the program. The bootcamp experience is definitely not for everyone. But if you do chose to take this path, I believe that you will find it very rewarding. As others have stated, and in the interest of full disclosure, I am being offered a sweatshirt as motivation for writing a review. I believe everything that I have written, and it is my honest assessment of the program and my experience in it. Best of luck in your search, and in making a life altering decision.

Read More the curriculum, the articles, videos, and project briefs were very well-curated and the mentors I came into contact with were all very professional and helpful. I am not sure that this program is for everyone but that has nothing to do with Springboard: If you're not a self-driven perfectionist, doing an online course at this intensity could become very overwhelming. However, I do think the mentor program helps give students the extra kick they might need to stay on track. Thanks to my mentor, who later took on the role of a 'colleague' and a 'friend' in addition to a 'mentor', I had a great time discussing and debating my research and design decisions with her. I also loved the professional research presentation and portfolio walkthrough—I was matched with some amazing UX professionals who gave me invaluable feedback and assured me of my talent and abilities. The only con I can really think of is that the course is essentially designed in a linear fashion and students often do not look through future units when they're working on something already. However, with the industry project and several presentations and mock interviews in the latter part of the course, time allocation and planning can become tricky if students want to finish the course in a certain time frame (for me, it was 4 months) and didn't plan ahead enough. It would be wonderful if there was a more user-friendly check list that provided students with more information on what's coming up next (e.g. deliverables and interviews expected in the next two units).I really loved this program and am proud of what I learned and compiled for my portfolio!

Other bootcamps charge $10,000+ for coursework that teaches the same principles over the same length of time. Additionally, springboard comes with a straight-forward job guarantee. The quality of the course material is repellent. I’m an avid learner and have taken many online courses through community colleges and state colleges. The amount of knowledge you gain and support you get from springboard makes universities look slow, petty, wasteful, unresourceful, and greedy. Much of the course material is drawn from online sources, but this is now common practice in higher academia. The coursework is highly informative and of sound quality (rivaling and surpassing the quality of a HCI course I took at PSU for example). What’s more, at the end of the career track you will also have a portfolio and a website platform to showcase all your work - critiqued by senior designer to make sure it looks right. And a CV and cover letter that is evaluated by those same designers. You also get a weekly one-on-one mentor throughout the length of the course. My mentor, Ciarda, tailored every session to my needs, was efficient beyond compare, and was always accessible. You can also schedule help from additional mentors whenever you need. Finally, the administration of springboard is flexible, personable, and does right by its students. I had the intention to complete the 6-month track within 3-months (I was on the month-to-month payment option so this would make the course $2,000 less for me). There were a few set-backs that pushed me a couple days past this deadline. The career track manager, Dave, very kindly worked with me through the obstacles to make sure everything worked out fairly. Going into it, I was worried a bootcamp might just be another form of degree-mill. The company isn’t about extorting students for money, but really wants to empower students to and earn a good name doing so. Way to go! I’ll likely be coming back for the AI/Machine Learning track once I get my Python up to speed. :)Read Less",springboard,11035

Right off the bat once the immersive portion kicked into high gear, we got exposure to Git, data structures,... Read More and we were pair programming daily through the day’s projects. The curriculum is well structured for layering in new technologies, and before you know it you’re familiar with relational databases and doing a deep dive into the inner workings of Rails. Things move at a bewildering pace, and it’s very easy to get caught off guard by this early on if you’re not careful. The looming thought of getting kicked out over failing two assessments can be extremely unsettling, but this risk/reward setup also puts the entirety of the cohort into a hyper focused mindset. And it creates a unique environment for learning if you can sublimate the anxiety of it. Even through the online setup, it was surprising just how much there was a sense of community. You spend hours every day with your classmates, and even through a computer screen I felt like I got to know a lot of them really well. I don’t know how they’re able to isolate so many brilliant people into these cohorts, but they clearly have very efficient and calculated screening mechanisms in place to ensure they’re taking quality people into the program. The TA’s are fantastic. The student to teacher ratio is very favorable for student teacher interactions, and they were consistently pivotal in getting me on track with the material on pace to get through the assessments. It’s a lot of information so be 100% prepared to have no life while you’re working through the curriculum. I thought 100 hours a week would be an exaggeration but I was consistently logging 95-100 hours each week studying the material straight through the weekend. You get to build your own full stack project using the core stack of the curriculum, as well as other projects with additional technologies that you learn past the React portion of the course. They’re in a re-vamping phase with their curriculum with less of a focus on Ruby as far as I understand, so this is something to bear in mind moving forward. I’m confident that however they re-structure the curriculum will be just as effective as the current setup they have in place and I’m sure it’s necessary given the industry’s trending away from Rails, but any large scale overhaul of a curriculum carries with it at least some amount of risk. I felt like the React portion was great. Past that things were still mostly well structured with minor hiccups. There were portions I felt were too rushed. For example, we had about a weekend to learn the MERN stack before we were working in a team to build an application in it that following week. Pieces of this curriculum might need some revision. Maybe something as simple as having at least one additional project with the MERN stack before having students code in a team environment in it. However I really enjoyed the Docker portion of the curriculum, and it was fun building an additional project with GraphQL / Apollo. I’ve heard this part of the curriculum is at the moment isolated to the online setups. You get to build a project in Vanilla JavaScript at the end of the course as well. App Academy’s deferred payment plan was a strong draw for me personally. I felt that this established them as an institution willing to take on a lot of risk investing in the people they take into the program, and shows that they’re confident their curriculum will get people placed in well-paying positions upon finishing. I’d honestly like to see more institutions of higher education adopt a similar financing approach. There are pros and cons to deciding on doing the online setup instead of an in-person setup, and I do believe an in-person setup would have been very fulfilling. Some people would say the in person setup is vital to the whole App Academy experience. But I do like that the online setup at least had a longer space of time for absorbing the material. You get a month prior to the official immersive portion of the cohort to get solid with software engineering fundamentals. And the TA’s were always readily available to answer any questions I might have, so at least on the learning side there was nothing lost in translation going this route. An in person bootcamp really wasn’t feasible for me personally, and I would expect it’s not for many others planning on applying. All things considered the past 24 weeks have been a grueling yet highly rewarding experience.

Read More started, the student advisors took time to answer any questions those starting the course had and did let us all know that this course was designed for those with limited experience in this field, which soothed my nerves. They also let us know that they (the student advisors) were there for any questions or concerns we may have had throughout the duration of the course, which was also very calming. When the course started, your mentor set up weekly Skype chats and you have your first introductory call with them, where you discuss your previous background, what it is you hope to gain from completing the course and ultimately, get to know them.When starting the course, you are presented with a library of knowledge for Excel with readthroughs and instructional videos ranging from basics to more advanced functions which becomes very helpful as the course moves on. It was also great that you can revisit these lessons, any time you get stuck.As you move forward into the case studies, you are given all the information needed. Extra material is provided that will help you specifically for the case you are working on complete with mock scenarios. What is required of you in each case study, is laid out in a way that is easy to follow and removes any guessing on your part.Although I was told to make sure your mentor is right for you and you feel comfortable working with them, mine was very helpful and knowledgable. **Do make sure you feel this way, if not, speak to your student advisor** They are there to help and guide you, not give you the answers and your weekly calls are key to being successful. They will review your progress and give you revisions to make if needed.Each case study I completed, focused on a different scenario (Forecasting, Root Cause Analysis, and Customer Segmentation) and really help me see the data I work with on a daily basis in a new light and made me think to myself, ""I could be doing better at this"" and as I was moving along in the course, I felt that my work had changed also, so I was taking what I learned and applying it immediately.FInal thoughts: It is a great course if you are looking to expand your knowledge in this particular field.

Should you apply for a coding boot camp? I can't give you a straight answer for this because it depends on your situation. But in my... Read More case, it was worth it for me, since my goal was to learn about full-stack web development and software engineering to be as fast as possible. I think App Academy does a great job at that, and you will be surprised at how quickly you can learn here. It would have taken me far longer of self-studying to be where I'm at today. Not to mention, I've also made some great friends along the way that I talk to every day.2. How should one prepare before applying to App Academy? I did the intro-to-programming section offered on https://www.aaonline.io and felt that I was ready to schedule a technical interview with AA. I was not, I failed my first interview and was lucky enough to get invited back for another. After failing, I realized that I needed much more practice. I practiced on https://www.codewars.com every day up until my next interview. You need to time yourself and talk out loud through the problem-solving process, preferably to a friend or family member. You should also be very comfortable working with arrays and hashes in Ruby and solving problems that may require nested loops. Sidenote: https://www.leetcode.com is another excellent place to practice. 3. How many hours per week to get through the program? Like many have said before me, this boot camp is no joke. Even if you put in 80+ hours per week, you will only be scratching the surface of the topics covered. But this is the tradeoff of getting yourself job-ready as fast as possible.4. How stressful is the program? If you have no programming experience, you will need to study hard to pass the six assessments. They cover Ruby algorithms, Ruby Object-Oriented Programming, SQL, Ruby on Rails, React, and JavaScript. If you fail two of the assessment tests, you must retake one of their choosing. If you fail the retake test, you will be booted out. Yes, it's stressful, but keep your focus on the material and the great job that you're going to get out of it, and you'll be fine.5. How is the curriculum? I think that some of the newer content at the end of the curriculum could use some improvement. But for the most part, it's fantastic. I know some people may be turned off by Ruby and Ruby on Rails, but don't worry about it, you will also build full-stack applications with the MERN stack.6. How are the instructors? From my experience, they were knowledgable and friendly. Leave the ego at the door and pick their brains as much as possible. They are a valuable resource. 7. What is a day like at App Academy? At 8 AM we would meet on Zoom, the instructors would cover the daily material before splitting us up into random pairs to work on the day's projects. Throughout the day, we had access to the instructors to ask them questions. About an hour before the end of the day, we would all meet to cover the material in the day's project. Before the next day, we would then complete the assigned homework.Great experience and I would do it again.Read Less",app-academy,10525

In the 3 months that you dedicate to App Academy, it is essentially... Read More the only thing that you can focus on. However, it is very rewarding in the end and you gain so much knowledge in such a short amount of time. Here are some personal tips and key points that I picked up from my experience at App Academy (Please note that this is from MY experience, and people accomplish/approach things in different ways):1. App Academy is challenging, but not INSANELY challenging. In my experience, I was able to keep up with App Academy's curriculum while maintaining some social/personal life. Other people say that they dedicate every day, every hour, every minute to App Academy (which is fine), but I felt that there was more free time than initially expected. I would be able to spend my Saturdays and sometimes Sundays doing social/personal stuff, and I honestly felt that this was needed.2. SLEEP is important. The instructors at App Academy can't stress this enough either. I think the thing that kept my stress level low and made my experience enjoyable was the fact that I forced myself to sleep with my regular schedule (I slept at 10:30pm and woke up at 7:30am everyday). I never felt tired during the working hours and I was still able to keep up with the curriculum. 3. You have to put in the effort to maintain this healthy lifestyle. The only reason why I was able to have fun on the weekends and get 8-9 hours of sleep everyday was the fact that I worked hard during the working hours. It's just as they say - work hard, play hard. If you actually pay attention during the lectures and actually put in your effort during the projects, you'll be able to absorb the information better, especially if you're not tired or stressed. My previous advice isn't to show that App Academy is easy, it's to show that there is a way to maintain good health and a happy lifestyle while going through the rigorous curriculum. Closing thoughts:I definitely don't know as much as those who dedicated every minute of their lives studying and working on App Academy, but I can confidently say that I was one of the happiest people there and truly enjoyed everyday of my experience with low stress. My approach was all about balance in my life, and I succeeded and made it to the end! Obviously, people work differently. If you need to lose some sleep to catch up on studying, that's fine. If you need even less days to study and can spend all weekend relaxing, that's fine too. I think the main thing is to not worry about what/how others are doing, and only focus on yourself and what YOU need to be successful and healthy.Read Less",app-academy,10525

A year later, I came across the self-driving car nanodegree by Udacity, and that's when everything changed.

Throughout the following 11 months, I was amazed by how detail-oriented the content was.

I was focused on deepening my understanding of how an autonomous system should behave and how to measure its performance, while having easy access to all the guides that helps understaning which SW tools are necessary for systems development. Right after I graduated the nanodegree, I found myself ready for a new challenge, and that is when I decided to start working on my masters. The nanodegree provided me with the core SW knowledge and resources, in addition to exploring all aspects of the autonomous vehicle domain, leaving me with experience and curiosity to face new challenges.

So you would ask how can Udacity opens your mind to the new world.! I will tell... Read More you...I know the experience that Udacity provides (Nanodegree) is not a traditional or usual experience and you might not have the confidence in the system but let me tell you my experience.Even my specialization was not related to software or any of the degrees that Udacity provides but I joined Udacity and I graduated With a nano degree -AI in python- (I worked so hard for 3 months and it was not easy at all I worked for 4 hours daily 6 days a week and one day to meet in person with the session lead and my colleague while having my regular 8 hours full-time job for 5 days a week ). My will when I graduated was to change my career to the software sector but then I recognized that there is more in the world than just having a job!The degree gave me more than the ability to have a new job, I can keep my old job and look for an online part-time or online remote job, for example, I can work as a freelancer for python tasks and earn money! And build my experience by myself which a thing you cant usually do with the regular jobs like if you are an electrical engineer you won't be able to work online since you must be present at the site to do your job! But the software you can do it on your own time at your own pace and there are many people online doing it.But afterward, I notice that there is another topic that is interesting the most to me (digital marketing)and I would join Udacity again to gain the skill and work in two directions (python &amp;digital marketing) beside my full-time job ( I know that's a lot of pressure but you know they say no pain no gain :) )The income from these online jobs that you can get after gaining the skill, can make you quit your full-time job! (This is when I noticed the world is changing and new opportunities are there we just need to catch it) you just need to set your mind that there is an opportunity waiting for you and you must commit to learning and building your experience, stay positive and goal-oriented and all this pain and hard work will get back to you.I hope my review helps you to set your mind and reconstruct your life.Thank you Udacity.

Read More material follows a clear and, to me, logical progression.

They also leave a lot of room for creative freedom! If you go online and search for ""Udacity VR projects"" there are hundreds of very different solutions to each project. They give plenty of time from the beginning of the lesson to the completion of the project, so I spent way too much time and had a lot of fun tweaking my projects and testing out new ideas before submitting it.My mentor, Victor, was extremely fast in getting back to me to answer my abundant amount of questions. He also helped me solve a problem in 5 lines of code that would have taken me days to figure out.If there are any downsides, I would say that a working knowledge of C# would greatly benefit.

I had more enjoyment in the early days, cutting up PSD files, creating complicated layouts via tables or css, making them responsive and functional cross-browser. When jQuery came into vogue, I hesitated a little but quickly loved the power and simplicity. But, as React and Angular started to dominate, I hated it; I didn't sign up for this ""real programming"" stuff! Udacity made the daunting task of transforming my approach manageable. It was a challenge, but the individual units were extremely well-structured and explained clearly. The best part of the course, however, are the medium-to-large projects that they have you create from scratch. They give you just the right amount of preparation to be able to achieve the applications from scratch. By the time you're completed, you have a comprehensive understanding of the concepts, and can use React and Redux together to create a lot of functionality that previously I would've considered too complicated to even attempt. And if you're stuck, they've got online chat groups which you can ask questions - or search archives of - to find solutions to your problems. And since everyone's writing their own apps from scratch, everyone approaches the problems with just enough uniqueness that you can't just do a search and copy/paste to fix your problem. It's that sweet spot where you'll find something similar, or be able to post your snippet and get feedback, but you're still doing all of the key mental work yourself and teaching yourself the concepts in practical situations.

Udacity being the top of the list naturally attracted me with its highly sophisticated and university level free courses.

Read MoreInitially, the Nanodegree gave me the foundations, the know-how to turn on the ignition and find my bearings. Graduating from it signified the beginning of an era where I can take matters into my own hands.Weighing the alternatives, I found that developing for Android isn't a subject widely taught at traditional brick and mortar institutions, but even if it was, enrolment would be probably too expensive. And what about learning through books? I would considered it as a plausible option if developing for Android was as solid and well defined as a programming language is. The problem here lies in the fact that Android is a fluent ecosystem comprised of dynamic components (lifecycle management, states, events, services, resources, layouts, views, loaders, UI/background threads), interconnections and patterns, which collectively form a tangling not easily conveyed through the static pages of a book.Self-paced, high quality, and evolving MOOCs, such as the Android Developer Nanodegree, form the modern shape of education and hold distinct advantages over their traditional instructor-led counterparts.While at University or now at work, I've attended quite a few instructor-led lectures or seminars that would span several days or weeks and the major problem with them was always feeling the stress of having to be constantly focused or risk getting left behind.Of course the teacher's quality is the other major factor, who is also burdened with having to examine several subjects in a limited time frame, hence impossible to do so in depth. The Nanodegree being self-paced for the student and being taught by a team including Google engineers solves both issues of the limited time frame and teacher quality. And what about the subtle and elaborate bugs in doing the exercises which won't start creeping until long after the lecture has ended? By then it's too late to get in touch with the teacher.What are you then supposed to do - research on your own, ask on Stackoverflow, or google for relevant results. Udacity on the contrary offers support through mentor-led forums serving personalized and quality help, accessible even after graduating.Let's not forget that graduating also gets you a Certificate. But how valuable is it? The IT industry, highly dynamic as it is, is being constantly reshaped by new inventions, trends and tools, all striving to become the new Kings of Software Development. Prime examples are Vue, Angular, React, Kotlin and so on, trends that a classic BSc issued by a traditional brick and mortar institution is not able to keep track of. The answer lies in seeing through the hype and adopting a life-long model of education which Udacity is able to provide.With regard to whether the Nanodegree is recognized industry-wide on a par with traditional diplomas, ptroviding you with the same chances of landing a job, I can't have an opinion since all the career options offered by Udacity are exlusively US based and I don't live in the US. Nevertheless, such a hard earned Certificate validates both the skills acquired and the real world experience gained through building quite a few Android apps, even releasing them to the Playstore.

Besides that, the market in Brazil was (and still is) no good due to the economic crisis for the traditional engineering positions. I liked programming and I wanted to change my career. I started study machine learning and after a few weeks, I discovered the Udacity nanodegree course. I thought that it would be a good idea doing a course focusing on real relevant projects and that someone could review my project, giving me good feedbacks. The Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree was very good and I decided to invest in a new course with a very hot topic: The Self Driving Engineer Nanodegree. It was more difficult than the Machine Learning course but I could pass through it with several hours of dedication.

The Udacity course price was at around R$2300; this is quite a hefty price for the average student in Brazil bear in mind that this was a promotional launch price.

During my work on the degree, some of the things I thought were great include:Human Graders! I'd done numerous courses with only automatic grading. That works to an extent, but certainly as things get more complicated, there is no substitute for receiving grades and COMMENTS from an actual human who really knows what they are talking about.Mentor Meetings: All Udacity students can schedule time with an actual person to go over anything needed. Though I didn't personally take advantage of this very often, the times I did were lifesavers. For someone not as accustomed to online learning, I can imagine these meetings would absolute necessities.Career Services: Having worked for 15 years in academia, the job search aspect of my prospective career change was quite daunting. It is an entirely different process applying for jobs in the ""real world"". Even just creating a resume was, for me, a brand new learning experience.

It was an amazing experience which turned me to a designer as I wished. I’m now a UI/UX designer in a development agency and having fun. I got the job offer in week 9... Read More - big shoutout to my instructor Brad who helped me with the performance check during the interview process as well as my TA Uzair who helped refurbish my resume and cover letter completely.A bit of my background: Before joining the program, I was working as a 3D artist in a VR studio. Then I was home tutoring high-schoolers and adults for 8 months. I had been wanting to be a designer doing some cool shit, but never had a job opportunity to get started. I sent my resume and portfolio to a bunch of companies in Vancouver, got responses, got tests, got interviews, but never got the position. I realized leaving the industry for a couple of months (when I was tutoring) made my sense dull and skills rusty - I need a place where I could sharpen everything again and get my thunder back.I’m gonna share a few reasons why I joined BrainStation and how the results ended up. If you have a similar situation and consider whether to join the program or not, my story may help you.First, I’m a layman. I need a place to teach me both practices and theories. I tried counting on myself to learn the skillset and toolkit of UX design, but it was frustrating coz I literally didn’t know where to start! To learn software first? Or read books? Or do a small project? UX is such a giant blackhole and could almost suck everything in: business analysis, research, information architecture, UI design, interaction design, visual design, content writing, or even front-end if you wanna be entitled as ‘full-stack designer’ (fascinating) - whatever you can possibly associate with product development. Yeah UX design is such a sugarcoated beast, sounds high-end, easy-going, user-friendly, but in reality quite intimidating and could bite your head off - if you dive in blindly without fair guidance. As a 3D modeler before, I did know Adobe Suite, but in terms of the latest tools of UI/UX design such as Sketch, InVision, Principle, etc., I’m a total outsider. Fortunately, during the pre-course, I learned the essentials of Sketch and InVision from the step-by-step tutorials; then throughout the next 10 weeks, I was improving my hard skills considerably by working on the weekly homework and capstone project. The instructor and TA would teach us tips every now and then to quicken our speed of work. As for theories, I did know user-centered design and some relevant approaches such as user stories, usability testing, but they were too scattered in my mind and never systematically came into a shape as ‘UX tree’ or ‘UX umbrella’. What BrainStation does is breaking down the whole UX topic to 10 smaller ones - each topic per week. Each week we focused on one topic and did homework around it to deepen our understanding. Meanwhile, we could update our capstone project by adopting the new stuff learned in that week. The weekly basis is fast indeed, even crazy (using one week to investigate UI design, are you kidding, that’s even a job title!), but come on, this is a bootcamp and we only have 10 weeks. This curriculum is brilliant in my opinion (and PPT is well-done): it takes care of all epics of UX design such as research, IA, UI design, etc. - which should be mastered more or less as a UX-er; but in reality, we could (and should) leverage our advantages and choose to specialize in one or a few directions. Taking myself as an example, I’m more interested and better at visual stuff than research, IA and business whatever, so I actually put more weight on the chapters of UI and visual design but honestly much less on certain sections (I got 55/100 once in one of my assignments, shame… ).Second, I’m lazy. Yes if nobody pulls me up, I could stay in bed for whole day. I tried saving money and studied on my own - and wonderfully, I slept in till 11 am, opened my laptop reluctantly, and lost morale in one hour. You know what’s so good after I joined the program? I COULDN’T SLACK OFF! Yeah I was busy like shit: class from 9 to 5, homework stacking up, capstone project crying for feed, workshops awaiting, portfolio pending - gosh, don’t ever underestimate ‘FULL-TIME’ training (this is not a joke). Frankly, the workload is immense - I was working in the evening, during the weekend, sometimes burning night oil. It’s not only because I myself wanted to work harder, but once I saw my classmates working their ass off, how could I sit still and enjoy being a couch potato? Most importantly, we paid to learn, so the only way not wasting the money is - work hard!! It’s painstaking, but it will pay off. Everyone in my cohort was progressing so much - I’ve seen people who made stunning interfaces in the end even having zero design background at the very beginning.Third, I’m an introvert. I bet you all know socializing is as important as swimming when you’re in the job-hunting pool. Sadly, I’m afraid of socializing and terrible at salesmanship. ESL is a reason but it’s more about my personality. I desperately needed a community at that moment where I could find a comfort zone with like-minded people. And yes BrainStation is like that for me. Amazingly, our cohort had 12 folks, and we teamed up differently for multiple projects, so everyone had a chance to work with each other. Every Friday, we went to a bar to grab beers after class. At the night of graduation, we barbecued, sang karaoke, like a bunch of weirdoes! People are professional at school but could be so wild afterward! The instructors are also super approaching (yeah they joined our beer too) and other staff are quite helpful (just ask them if you need a favor.) Besides, we have tech-talks, workshops, and presentations every week, so don’t worry, you’ll be pushed under the spotlight and try your best to entertain the audience! (I remember I was the rockstar among one of the presentations!) In summary, if you’re like me, not good at networking, then at least you will have your cohort and the staff, which will become your own community and, it’s still growing.Last but not least, I bet the tuition is a big concern to most of us and I admit it’s not a small number. I was jobless and broke from the moment I gave up on my tutoring gig, so yeah I thought about money a lot. So I tried two options to make it less unaffordable: firstly, applying for the scholarship. Do ask the staff what kind of scholarship you are eligible for; secondly, there’s an instalment option to pay off the debt in 12 months (and I chose this). Good news is you can use the tuition for tax return, yeah! And once you land on a new job after graduation, I suppose you won’t mind this educational investment. (The common salary of junior UI/UX designer in BC is 40k-50k.)In conclusion, this was my happiest training experience, maybe because I finally found what I like to do. I hope my story could help you in any way. Good luck and keep it up!Read Less",brainstation,10571

Read More to progress without one so I can't tell more. I heard this changed in the new monthly payment model where mentors are much more compromised and even have regular calls with you. That was the only negative aspect. All the following is positive. The content quality is superb, it's carefully picked and written/recorded in a very understandable way. It's split in a perfect way in order for you to not learn too many things at once, so you don't have ""learning fatigue"". The instructor is a truly expert in the field, and he went beyond a typical course, giving you not only the what and how, but also the why and best practices. It's not only videos, you have also text and quizes, so you don't get bored with pure videos like in other courses (at least me). And probably the key learning feature: the projects. There were 3 projects you had to complete (+1 optional), these truly consolidated all the material learned. The best is that they are reviewed by a Udacity reviewer, who gives you very valuable feedback on the parts that could be improved. Besides practicing, this adds to your portfolio and also gives you the confidence that you're proficient in the technology (React in my case). You don't get this in other courses. Can you find equivalent free material by googling? In theory you can but 1) It would take ages to find it (time is money) 2) It would be of different qualities and teaching methodologies and 3) you won't get review from experts. The career advice (which came for free with the nanodegree) was also a big plus, To be honest I never cared about my LinkedIn and Github, but Udacity reviewed my profiles and made me awesome suggestions to improve them. I also improved my resume based on their reviews. Then I got more job opportunities (I got a salary raise to not leave my current job due to a new offer I received through LinkedIn).

Apparently, udacity was upgrading the course materials or part of the course materials were not completed. Also in the spark lesson some of the lesson content was added in the middle of the nanodegree. That was a bit annoying and frustrating that udacity launched a product before it was fully prepared. 2. The program mentioned intermediate Python Programming and intermediate SQL knowledge. I thought some of the basic parts of the course like how to connect a database could have been shown a bit more details. I struggled with this part. 3. The Apache Airflow lesson- I found it a bit more advanced compared to the things covered in the course. I think few more exercises could have helped. 4. The cost at this point is little to high- udacity should reconsider the price issue. Now the good things: 1. I had a very good mentor and the mentor also was from same time zone. I really got a lot of assistance from him. This was the single most important factor for which I could complete the degree. 2. The projects were good, the project reviews were also good.

I’d say the greatest strengths of the program are the challenge, the support,... Read More and the accountability. The principal three-month curriculum is incredibly intense—expect 60-hour weeks at absolute minimum—but it takes you through the skills and concepts you need to know and forces you to put in the necessary work to really learn them. The instructors and TAs, though they can occasionally be overwhelmed (many are graduates of the course), are always on hand to offer helpful feedback that’s often critical to bringing together your understanding of a concept. It’s all about putting you in a structure that incentivizes you to actually put in the work, and this continues even after graduation, as you get individualized coaching and reporting tools that make sure you regularly apply to jobs and continue working on projects and coding challenges. This is especially valuable because the job search can take time—around three months in my case—and you’ll absolutely have more to learn after you graduate. Twelve weeks can’t cover every nuance of software engineering. As far as downsides, the instruction is sometimes shaky, as I said above, though years in business have polished the curriculum to the point where you’ll usually have pre-prepared resources to help you out if worst comes to worst. Your continued participation in the course depends on you passing the regular assessments, which is a major source of stress even if you have a handle on the material and prepare well. The assessments themselves also can feel more like tests of memorization than genuine reflections of how much you’ve learned. Last but not least, despite App Academy’s stated (and admirable) goal of bringing people from more diverse backgrounds into the tech industry, most of the classes seem to be overwhelmingly male, even more so than the industry as a whole. That won’t be an issue for everybody, but it’s worth mentioning. Still, I have no regrets.

That being said I would not trade the experience for anything. Going through App Academy 24 week course is one of the things I am most proud of. Just for... Read More a bit of context I am a 21 year old high school dropout that didn't finish the 10th grade and was in and out of homeless/domestic violence shelters with my mom and sisters. sufficient to say we missed a lot of school. My son was born when I was 16, married my high-school sweetheart at 17, and my daughter was born when I was 19. The point is that there was there was every reason for me to think that I wasn't good enough to have the title Software Engineer. However, 3 weeks ago I finished the 24 week online course and can say with a high degree of certainty that I will land a job in the next few months (Will update onChange). This is not say that the course is not hard. It was the single hardest thing that I have ever done. When they say 100 hours a week they mean it. I personally did at least 16 hour days 7 days a week for 20 weeks( throughout the main part of the course). Did many all nighters and even more 20 hour days to stay caught up. Basically if i wasn't sleeping/eating I was studying. App Academy doesn't just teach you all of the skills to be a successful Software Engineer, as corny as it is to say they really do teach you how to learn. The very dedicated,patient and knowledgeable T.As brake vary hard concepts down to the absolute base foundation, then start building on it at a pase that is continously pushing you passed what you thought was your limit. I would like to take the chance to shine a light on a T.A named Trevor. He is a shining example of why App Academy is the best. aA hire's Caring, knowledgeable and relatable engineers to give you the best possible chance. I think I can speak for any/all of my fellow corhotins that regardless of the language/stack/problem, we have the skills to pick up whatever is put in front of us and quickly be able to preform the task at an industry standard level. The Friendships and relationships that I made over the last 6 months will last a lifetime. In conclusion the decision to commit to app academy should not be taken lightly, it definitely lives up to the name bootcamp. I can admit that I was not smartest person in my class but what I lacked in natural intelligence was overwriten by alot of hard work and a very well layed out plan.

Job and career coaches are really dedicated to helping you get your materials together and seem to genuinely care about your success after the program ends. Course work is really relevant and tailored to languages and frameworks that are considered relevant/trendy in the industry, as well as plenty of attention given to theory/algorithms/more theoretical material that will help in interviews, as well as just general programming knowledge. Big focus on Ruby/Rails in the beginning, with a hard shift to JavaScript about halfway. Will feel very comfortable with both by the end. You are very on your own for the projects. Instructors will help with large bugs, but other than that, you pretty much utilize what you learned in the previous 12 weeks of the course.

Very quickly, I applied the skills I learned in class to real-life challenges at my job. I took the “Online Live” version of the course, so there was a bit of adjustment in the beginning. A few things you might want to consider when choosing online live over in-class:Pros: — You can attend class from anywhere. Although the instructor is based in Vancouver, we had individuals who checked in from other cities and time zones. — The format of the online live version is just like the in-class version. No worries about feeling like you’re missing out on the BrainStation experience. — Things were easier to see because it was happening right on your computer screen instead of squinting at a monitor at the front of a classroom. Cons:— You miss out on some of the spontaneity and organic conversation that occurs in a real-life classroom. People in the class seemed to be apprehensive about chiming in because it’s a video conference.— Since data analytics is a very hands-on type of class as opposed to something like digital marketing which involves a lot more explanation of concepts, you miss out on some of the benefits of having an instructor physically present. For example, many students ran into some tech issues when using SQL or Tableau, but they couldn’t easily show their screen to the instructor. Overall, the instructor dealt with these issues to the best of his abilities.

I had so much fun learning how to code and am grateful for this life-changing experience! Like many of the online sources say, it IS really challenging. In the 3 months that you dedicate to App Academy, it is essentially... Read More the only thing that you can focus on. However, it is very rewarding in the end and you gain so much knowledge in such a short amount of time. Here are some personal tips and key points that I picked up from my experience at App Academy (Please note that this is from MY experience, and people accomplish/approach things in different ways):1. App Academy is challenging, but not INSANELY challenging. In my experience, I was able to keep up with App Academy's curriculum while maintaining some social/personal life. Other people say that they dedicate every day, every hour, every minute to App Academy (which is fine), but I felt that there was more free time than initially expected. I would be able to spend my Saturdays and sometimes Sundays doing social/personal stuff, and I honestly felt that this was needed.2. SLEEP is important. The instructors at App Academy can't stress this enough either. I think the thing that kept my stress level low and made my experience enjoyable was the fact that I forced myself to sleep with my regular schedule (I slept at 10:30pm and woke up at 7:30am everyday). I never felt tired during the working hours and I was still able to keep up with the curriculum.3. You have to put in the effort to maintain this healthy lifestyle. The only reason why I was able to have fun on the weekends and get 8-9 hours of sleep everyday was the fact that I worked hard during the working hours. It's just as they say - work hard, play hard. If you actually pay attention during the lectures and actually put in your effort during the projects, you'll be able to absorb the information better, especially if you're not tired or stressed. My previous advice isn't to show that App Academy is easy, it's to show that there is a way to maintain good health and a happy lifestyle while going through the rigorous curriculum.Read Less",app-academy,10525

What I love most about App Academy is that despite my prior experience in programming, I was constantly challenged and learned something new each... Read More day. The curriculum is rich enough that even the more experienced programmers will feel like they're getting something out of it. I can't recommend this program enough for those that are looking for a bootcamp. However, my main suggestion is that prior to applying or even considering this bootcamp, you should learn to code. I know this sounds counterintuitive, but the purpose of a bootcamp is not just to teach you how to code, it's to help get a job to build a career. In addition, learning to code prior gives you a sense on whether or not you even enjoy learning how to code. If you do, then definitely put in some time to learn prior to applying. It not only prepares you for the admissions interview but also will help you immensely in the program. App Academy is incredibly competitive and while there are many people that come into this program with little to no knowledge of how to code and ultimately succeed, there are many that don't make it pass the first few weeks. This is simply because the program has a strike out policy where if they deem that you're too far behind in their expectations of where you should be, you could get dismissed. App Academy is a great investment and I highly recommend that those that are considering this program will also consider the time and commitment. Everyone will do whatever it takes to make sure that you learn the material and get that job but only if you're willing to do your part in that process as well.Pros:• Rich curriculum of learning full-stack development and job searching • Has career coaches that work extensively to help you find a job • Relatively affordable: for those that can't pay the entire tuition out of pocket, the deferred plan is a great option that asks for a deposit and a fraction of your first year's income. This is a great choice because other bootcamps have policies that extend over 1 year and the repayment is little compared to what you'll be making as a software engineer. • Learn by doing: The curriculum emphasizes learning by doing. So you'll be working on a lot of projects but don't worry. The projects are not expected to be completed. They're meant to be for YOUR learning experience.Cons:• San Francisco is expensive. If you don't live in San Francisco, expect to dedicate some time commuting to and from the campus (SF traffic sucks). • Doesn't necessarily take into account everyone's learning style. I learn better when I'm coding along with someone but lectures don't allow for computers so it's difficult to pay attention when I have to write notes with pen and paper while trying to follow lecture slides. • Too much pair programming: App Academy focuses on pair programming to get students to learn how to communicate and work with partners. This style is the majority of the program. It would be nice if we had more days to work by ourselves to learn the material at our own pace.Read Less",app-academy,10525

Read More prior programming experience, so the first month of so was basically review to me while most of my peers were learning the basics of programming. I can say that I came away from this course as a better programmer, and fully equipped with the tools necessary to find a job as a software developer. The pace is very fast - you're learning something new every day. It ramps up in speed - we spent the first month working with Ruby, and at the end we went through the Javascript curriculum in only a week. The pair programming experience is great - 95% of my classmates were there to learn and were motivated. You'll be doing pair programming for 10 weeks with a new person everyday, so at the end of it you make some pretty good friends and networking connections out of it. 95% of the stuff you learn is useful; you end up using most of it for the 3 projects at the end that you are required to do. The instructors are great and all of them are there to help you succeed and do better.I am currently in the job search curriculum portion, where I get lectures on topics such as networking, writing cover letters and resumes, and interviewing. After I graduate, I will be working with a career coach from App Academy for upwards of a year until I find a job. Once you graduate, it doesn't stop - they expect you to spend 8 hours a day, 40 hours of week working on finding a job. If you work better with imposed deadlines, then this is immensely helpful as it prevents you from procrastinating. Overall - I think that the program is worth the value in tuition. I would recommend payment upfront rather than the deferred model, since you pay less and there's less pressure to find a job after you graduate.

Read More questions than my friends with CS degrees said they were when they started job searching. In fact a bunch of people in my cohort already had legit CS degrees.

I switched from the SF cohort to Online when I found out I was having a baby (which they were very supportive of) and it was like a completely different bootcamp just because I got some over-the-top friendly instructors. Not a serious issue though because a/A's written and video resources are fantastic, and all the instructors are super capable engineers that can help you track down and conceptually understand any bug you hit in your code. Other side note, I strongly recommend dabbling through one or two Udemy courses before starting a/A though if you literally have no coding experience (I did the first half of Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp, loved it). Not because you necessarily have to, but it'll make a/A more fun and less stressful. That said, my BFF from the program had zero coding experience and was working at Home Depot before doing a/A.

Now finished with the course, I do see the benefit of it so make sure you are doing it.The next 21 weeks. (normal ""office"" hours)Full day programming (my schedule was 10am to 1:15pm morning lectures/programming, 1:15-2:30 lunch, 2:30-4:45 pair programming, 4:45-5:00pm break, then 5-7pm more programming (with occasional evening lectures). The pair programming definitely helps pass the time (depending on the partner). Most cohort members were at a similar level while some students with previous computer science backgrounds were far ahead of everyone else. We had an AMAZING group of instructors who helped us along the way. I feel like that is the greatest thing I enjoyed about the course. not once was I made to feel bad about struggling with the content. The instructors were genuine in their desire to help us learn and succeed. (after ""office"" hours)Get ready to eat a meal, perhaps relax for 30 mins or so, then go into anywhere between 2-4 hours of readings/homework. Do not let up on this or you will fall behind. Also, think of the best way that you learn and go with it. I took paper notes on my reading the first couple of months then switched to google keep note taking half way through. Honestly, I feel like the note taking took longer but I absorbed the content better. Although it is nice to have a digital searchable archive of my notes. Try to absorb the material but not necessarily memorize it. Doing the homework will help you be ready to pair program which will keep you on track. Oh and don't forget to fill out your evening reports. We were were not told this until towards the end, but those reports (""what I learned"", ""challenges"", etc) can be useful during your job search. Because of this, it may be useful to take notes as you work for these reports (you will likely be tired by the time reports are available to be filled out).(curriculum) Honestly, most of it is really good stuff. The projects give you hands on experience on the content and material you read about the night before. There are a ton of projects but it seemed like the goal was exposure not necessarily building a portofilio (until the last weeks). You have assistance when you need it and hopefully a fun partner each day that you work with. There were a few projects/assignments that I really enjoyed and some that I really didn't. Some projects are very applicable to the real world, (building websites, designing, constructing games/apps) while others are very scholastic(working on algorithms/math type problems, and writing ""lite"" versions of complicated stuff so you have a better understanding or appreciation). I honestly feel like some of the scholastic projects could be removed and the course would be enhanced. The two months are working solo as well as in a team to develop multiple web applications from scratch (from a pre-approved list). You will also make a portfolio and prepare for the job search (with readings and homework). This was probably my most favorite time and the hard work you did in the A05-A06 curriculum will pay off here. Feel free to check out my portfolio for samples of the types of projects. www.samgutierrez.com(strikes)App Academy does have a policy in place to hold people accountable to their work and being in class. For the most part, I see it as generous. You really can't be kicked out if you are doing what you are supposed to. The Job Search: After you complete your projects and your official last day the hard work isn't over.You are given a career coach who work with you to get you ready for the job search. He or she will require multiple things to be met each week. You must get a certain number of points per week and a certain number of application or you are given a strike. Personal tips:Don't over commit yourself.My marathon:I had already committed a couple months of training prior to signing up for a/A. This would be my second marathon and 10th or so long run event. I was on track for a 3:30 marathon PB but the marathon was not until 4 months later. Rather than paying to downgrade my marathon to a half or 10k ($100 bucks to do so), i just opted to continue with it. My training regiment had me doing a small amount of miles at the start of the course so the first month felt like a breeze. However, the next 21 weeks were living and breathing code and more strenuous running workouts. My schedule consisted of waking up early in the morning (after late evenings of homework) and training for my marathon for about an hour with long runs on weekends. Aside from that, I quickly began battling over tightness of my quads that never let up (and eventually led to injury). I got to 3 months into the course before I started experiencing Achilles issues. By the time the marathon came around I was not in good shape. Mentally exhausted from the course work and assessments and dealing with the Achilles issues, as well as unforeseen family medical emergency. There were days when I couldn't even run a mile before my Achilles just forced me to walk. Luckily, I abandoned my PB goal and was now just focused on not injuring myself but foolishly kept pushing. I ended up completing the marathon in 5 hours and 20 mins. Was it worth it....maybe? lol It felt like a bigger accomplishment than my first marathon but of course but the damage had been done. I am still struggling with Achilles injury (3 months after marathon) and fell behind during the most difficult, and honestly what I felt like, the most important portion of the course. Of course with no longer having to train, I was able to manage to get myself up to par but at more stress. My advice, think long and hard about committing to anything during this time. You will definitely benefit from having the extra time. Equipment:Get a second monitor, mouse, and a decent computer if you don't have one. Laptops are good but honestly I feel like the $300 used imac that I bought is so much easier to work on then the macbook pro I worked on for one day. It is a world of difference having to constantly minimize or drag things around just to see your code. Set up your equipment somewhere where you will not having distractions (this will be super important during assessments) but will also help your day to day. I moved my equipment from a second bedroom (with one window) to my living room with 3 because it got more daylight. This made a huge difference in my productivity because I felt the day longer (didn't get tired as easily), could hear birds chirping instead of the neighbor's kids on their trampoline, and could also let my dogs play outside while I monitored them through the window (as opposed to keeping them cooped all day and feeling guilty)! The sunlight also keeps you sane because depending on your time zone you may not actually be outside during daylight otherwise. If you have a savings and are able to invest a bit more a Solid State Drive would be helpful. Make sure you are using an ethernet connection for reliable video signal and consider investing in a inexpensive external microphone. This won't really be enforced but you will make it a better experience for you and your classmates.Read Less",app-academy,10525

I'd always been interested in tech, but could a bootcamp really take me from nothing to software developer in 6 months?... Read More The answer is... Yes! BUT you have to be ready to put in a tremendous amount of passion, dedication, time, and effort. There's no magic secret to App Academy... It's just a lot of hard work. No one can learn to code for you, and no one can get a job for you... That's all on you! But App Academy provides you with all the tools and support you need, and it was a truly life changing experience for me. The core curriculum (as it was when I attended) is incredible - I can't praise it enough. You don't just learn web development frameworks, you learn how they work under the hood. The TA's are always willing to help you when you run into issues, no matter how long it takes. And your fellow cohort mates will be fun to work with! A lot of students (including myself) were dubious of pair programming in the beginning... And although it's not perfect, the pros far outweigh the cons. Communicating your code to others is a make-or-break skill in the job search, and pair programming is a great way to develop that skill. Some days of pairing will be better than others, but that's just life haha. If you're worried about the workload, don't be. Well ok... maybe worry a little haha. App Academy will keep you busy all day, every day for the entirety of the program, weekends included. This is especially true if you're striving for a deep understanding of the material (which you should be!). But learning software development is a fun and rewarding process, and although the workload was immense, I found it enjoyable. There will be times when you feel overwhelmed, but there's a strangely satisfying feeling that comes from being thrashed day after day after day haha. I think the most difficult part is the end of the course when you're building your own projects. I'm a perfectionist, so I put a lot of pressure on myself, and worked very long hours. I had no school or prior experience, so I knew my portfolio would be a critical part in showing off my abilities as a developer. Once projects are completed, you will move into the job search, which is a completely different challenge. You have to balance sending out plenty of applications, preparing for interviews and continuing to learn and grow as a developer. You will be responsible for structuring your days and holding yourself accountable, and it's really easy to get lazy and unmotivated (I know I did), especially when your pipeline is empty. Also, don't expect your career coach to get you a job - there's only so much they can do. To give some detailed job search stats, I sent out a total of 333 applications, which resulted in 8 phone screens, 3 coding challenges, 2 on-sites, and 1 job. I was extremely fortunate.All in all, App Academy was an amazing experience. However, it seems like App Academy is growing and changing, as all companies do. I can't say for certain if the experience of future cohorts will be the same as mine. I know the curriculum has been completely overhauled, and I'm not sure I would call it an improvement, based on what I've seen. It'll be up to you to decide if App Academy is the right choice, but I'm happy to say that it worked out very well for me, as well as many students before me. If you've made the decision to become a software engineer, App Academy is definitely worth consideration!Read Less",app-academy,10525

Further I highly considered joining the in person Galvanize bootcamp in Denver, including visiting them for a tour. Why choose Springboard? To drive and hour into a city, Denver, 5 days a week for 13 weeks was a big stressor on top of the curriculum for Galvanize. I looked into living there in the city, which is not my comfort zone and very expensive! Thinkful seemed to be extremely similar to Springboard, and General Assembly too. All had requirements of living within an hour of particular major cities. I ultimately landed on Springboard midsummer because they listed both Denver and Detroit as their major cities for required money back guarantees and opportunities.

Within two weeks, I knew how to code in Ruby and solve algorithm problems! I was really excited to find out about all that I would learn (if and) when I got in. Fast forward through the smooth-sailing admissions process, I entered App Academy on my first day and met a lot of great people who later became some of my closest friends! I did not realize how hard, and intense the program would be. There were times where I wondered if I could keep up and make it through the program (there definitely were people who got dropped - and I think it's because they didn't take it as seriously, not because they were lacking the smarts) but the teachers and my fellow peers were extremely supportive. You never realize how much you could learn, and App Academy fosters the right culture and environment for that.I would say that the only drawback was that sometimes the curriculum seemed a bit outdated, and the instructions weren't as clear. But even with those kinks, we learned how to work around this which challenged us as developers (to find solutions when we were unsure of what to do). Anyway, I would say moving towards the end, you will find yourself feeling like a brand new person. The alumni community is great - people who have graduated from here will talk to you on LinkedIn.

The curriculum is littered with mini-projects for students to practice their new skills further. The best part of the program for me was probably the mentor experience. The weekly meetings are opportunities to not just review your capstone projects, but to learn how to think like a professional. If you ever feel like you need more time to discuss something (and those half hour sessions can feel short), most mentors are available for messaging or possibly even extra sessions.

While I talked to my mentor about some of them, I never saw a single review in writing. I think this would be a great opportunity to discuss theory and practice code reviews.- Course material needs to be expanded in some key areas.  -Deployment was limited to one Github mini-project and a very high-level overview video. Graduating students should probably have some familiarity with Docker or other software for productionization. - Distributed computing was covered in just two sets of exercises. I'd prefer if there were not just more material on the subject, but some more discussion of the underlying theory. - While this may have been a result of me taking the ""generalist"" track, I felt the material on deep learning was way too light. We were given only one optional exercise that worked with Keras, despite it being the easiest major DL framework to learn and the least likely to be implemented at scale. Even some more optional reading material would have been nice.

Additionally, your mentor will direct you to a lot of additional online materials to supplement your learningEg:- My mentor has 6+ years of experience (same as mine)Office HoursWhile the weekly office hours are on a wide range of topic and not necessarily related to your progress on the course (not sure if that is even possible given a rolling cohort model of admission), they are a great insight into how Data Science is applied in the industry and the speakers give a lot of leads in terms of additional materials related to the topic of discussion. A brief note down of such leads act as great supplementary material when you are actually learning the topicGeneral Tips to benefit from any online MOOC/BootcampData Science, as a pathway, requires continuous learning beyond standard classroom methodology and the more materials you refer to while building your foundational concepts, the better your understanding will be.Springboard’s course gives you that direction and streamlines your learning path along with a mentor who will help you navigate in this journey.PS:- This is not a paid/biased review since I chose Springboard after going through several online bootcamp offerings (GreyAtom, Lambda School, RMOTR etc. For any further details on this, plese feel free to DM me. While I might not be a data science expert yet, however I am happy to guide you in terms of how to leverage this career track and stay motivated all the way through.And regarding the worthyness of the course, having invested my heard-earned money into this, it’s highly recommended with the caveat that be prepred to grill yourself and as long as you keep up your motivation high, you will definitely see the benefit of this learning journey as you proceed along.Read Less",springboard,11035

Read More the concepts nicely and shared a lot of examples from his work life which made the application of all the marketing concepts very real and easier to appreciate.

You log in from the convenience of your home and the platform uses great collaboration tools like Zoom, Slack and their own Synapse platform which makes the learning experience very interactive and cohesive. I definitely miss that in the other online courses that are either not live or simply lack the maturity in terms of collaboration tools and software. Kudos to the Brainstation leadership team for their thought leadership and vision in launching this truly online and digital learning platform2.	Breadth of course and quality of content: Digital marketing is a vast field and not an easy topic to cover within a 10-12 week part time learning format. This is another area where Brainstation did an excellent job. They organized Digital Marketing into 8 areas and covered all key channels such as SEO, SEM, social media and email marketing. It served as a great introduction and their slide content was great in terms of simplifying the concepts and quoting relevant examples from time to time. 3.	Duration of course: This is a key component of any online learning course. If a course goes on for too long and it feels like a drag causing you to lose interest, cut it too short and you feel like you did not get enough out of the course. I feel like Brainstation got this right at 10 week course duration. I feel like a 10-12 week duration is optimal at least for someone like me who wants to do many things and tends to lose interest easily. 4.	Specialty focus on FB:If you know even a little about Digital Marketing you know that FaceBook is the king of all digital marketing platforms and simply cannot be beat. Their acquisitions of IG and WhatsApp have only made them stronger. I love that Brainstation decided to make FB the focus social media platform and dedicates a significant portion of the course to helping understand FaceBook’s comprehensive advertising platform. I also realized that once I got a good understanding of FB, it got much easier to pick up any new social media marketing platform. 5.	Sense of community and continued learning:This was one of the most important differentiators for me. Although this was an online course, I felt very connected to the entire Brainstation community though every aspect of the course identification , admission and learning process. The Brainstation learning team has great advisors that are super responsive to your questions and do a great job of engaging you by including you in all the relevant collaboration and communication platforms.

Read More the instructors clearly want all the students to succeed, and the readings, homework, projects and lectures are all geared to make sure you hit the necessary benchmarks during the course. The general structure of regular assessments with severe consequences (can lead to being kicked out of the course) adds a significant amount of stress for students. While I understand the reasoning for this from App Academy's perspective, and believe that it is an overall positive, it can lead to a sense at points that instructors are ""teaching to the test"". While the pace of the bootcamp is very rapid, the structure of the course materials and projects means that you'll end up working over the same concepts multiple times after their initial introduction, the end result of which is that App Academy will teach you a huge amount of skills in a relatively short period of time. My cohort at App Academy was originally intended to be in person, but ended up being entirely remote due to COVID-19. I don't believe this had a large impact on the skills I've learned in the course, and the instructional team did a great job of adapting to a life on Zoom for the duration of the course. That said, you definitely lose a lot of the social aspects of an intensive bootcamp with the remote setup. Finally, I'm just entering the job search currently, so can't speak much to the support App Academy will provide during this period.  The job search material covered has been helpful and informative, but this final portion of the curriculum has felt more disorganized and has not inspired the confidence in this transition to job hunting that I had hoped for given the way the majority of the bootcamp was run. Overall, if you are looking to jump start a career as a software engineer, I would absolutely recommend App Academy -- just make sure that your expectations for workload and result are set correctly.Read Less",app-academy,10525

Benefits:* The latter half of the program teaches the frameworks mentioned above alongside building projects with those frameworks to populate a portfolio on your resume. I was delighted to find that they tackle every aspect of the job search process, since I had effectively no portfolio before a/A.* Schedule includes weeks to focus entirely on projects and gain skills working on a team, as well as 'half-and-half' weeks to do solo projects and resume crafting, and of course many more weeks spent on new concepts.* Schedule is very flexible, and instruction team is fair. Assessments may be curved or re-evaluated based on the cohort. * Every member of app academy (that I interacted with) takes responsibility if something is wrong or needs clarification, fixing, or more time. I don't remember anyone being unapproachable. Criticisms:* When students get deferred to another cohort, they simply disappear. I understand it may be embarrassing to defer (although it shouldn't be - life happens, you need more time, it didn't click), but just silently removing them might not be the best solution. I felt the cohort steadily shrinking as people left, and became increasingly stressed that it would happen to me, since we were the first cohort of the year and the students ahead of us had different curriculum and couldn't join us. Most other cohorts will not be in this situation, though, as they will have new students join.* The 24 week pace isn't as consistent as I'd like. The first 4 weeks are essentially just making sure you passed the free online intro to programming course that they offer, or getting you up to speed if you didn't. It very quickly ramps up, and some weeks have very difficult assessments while other weeks see a class average of 100%. I understand some material is very hard to assess, though - such as learning a new framework or database, where it is more trivia than anything else. Final jurisdiction:I had graduated from uni without much of a portfolio, and without the ability to pass coding interviews despite my degree. In my opinion, the curriculum should be a little more polished and probably focus more on algorithms and react (the most important, most recurring subjects).

They come in all varieties... Read More such as socio-economic issues, app functionality, matters of convenience and satisfaction, and visual aesthetics. It's hard to be good at them all. The UX career track at Springboard will give you your fair share of experience in each until you come to understand what it is about UX that you are best at. For me, it's research and strategy. I can hold my own all the way through the design process, but I find the most joy thinking about the why's, and bringing insights into design. I like to solve problems on a systemic level.As for the course, it's a highly sufficient curriculum that has enabled me to feel confident as I continue to learn design. The program has well vetted UX mentors that are industry veterans and are quite successful. And, the team of career coaches I've interacted with has been top quality. These people are true professionals and THEIR job is to get YOU a job. That's a promise.But, it's still all on you. Make no mistake. A career transition isn't for the feint of heart, especially design. The good thing is that we are makers, so you should never stop making something. Never stop learning, and be courageous. And, be prepared to work for free or below your 'paygrade' (at first).I am currently working on various passion projects that I will add to my portfolio in addition to the three projects I completed through the Springboard curriculum. Be mindful, you who are reading this, that UX isn't something you stop learning. I know there is a lot of information out there, though, and it can be overwhelming. Springboard was a great pathway for me to understand UX in principle and in process. But, don't stop with what they give you or it won't be enough. With that foundation of knowledge and experience, I've been able to further investigate principles I enjoy, and find methods that fit my needs and specific style. Springboard teaches design thinking, but there are other umbrellas of UX understanding such as CX and User-centered design, which Springboard introduces briefly.Being a problem solver, I revolve around the core of UX, which is finding pain points. I've also incorporated a problem solving framework called customer jobs aka jobs to be done. I'm also investigating systems thinking and system's diagramming to use in tandem. These are just examples of many different UX frameworks you can add to your metaphorical toolbelt. Just find what you gravitate to. It's equally important to spend time designing and working with others. Other designers are your allies, but don't get too caught up in trying to be everyone's friend. Building meaningful relationships means being professional first. Add value to get value. Be genuine and authentic, seriously. Just be you.Being you is very important because design interviews are really hard. You have to be tenacious the same as any jobsearch, but you are going to basically be auditioning many times during interview rounds. Jobs will want to see how you design and how you will work with their team. So, prepare well for the mock interviews, which are effectively the finals for the UX course, or you won't get the job guarantee that comes with the course, and you may not even get a job even after all that. But, without risk there is no reward. And, so long as you put 100% into your projects, you will be a confident enough designer to showcase your work in an interview.I found a home in design because of Springboard. I truly believe that. My first love is writing, and always will be. But, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to be a problem solver by trade. I used Springboard to get an idea I had off the ground, and I'm so glad I did.

Read More to admit it kept me on my toes! The course itself has major blocks: Excel, MySQL and Tableau. The first two classes were about working in Excel from basics to more advanced level, and it was ok. I understand that it was a necessity, and lots of students come with different levels of experience. Although I wish we either focused more on advanced Excel or covered that material within one class. After that, we moved on to MySQL and I found that part of the course the most interesting and exciting. For the next 4 classes, we were learning basic as well as advanced commands in MySQL Workbench and participating in the class exercises. The last three classes were with Tableau, where I wish we had more assignments and tasks to do. Somewhere in the middle, we were broken into teams to prepare for our Final projects. And that was the most important part of the class. While you get all the necessary knowledge with Brainstation to get started, a major part of learning comes from the work that you do outside of the class. I cannot even describe the amount of reading I had to do to solve one problem that was standing on our way. By putting extra time into learning I ended up feeling very confident in my knowledge and skills. Now I understand that you don't always get to choose your teammates, but I got very lucky. My team was great, and we were working in sync until the end of the course. Communication was the key and I could clearly see the teams that had such a problem in their final presentations. By working together you can really create an amazing experience and enjoy the process. Our instructor was Ramin Amin, who over the length of the course was very direct in his approach, and could explain the material very well. I have to admit that the level of support that he provided outside of the class was just great. Anytime I had a problem or a question, he would get back to me within a few hours with advice or a solution.

1877,267616,0,,2020.0,0,Staff Software Engineer,User Interface Design Certificate Course,5.0,5.0,5.0,,"I just completed my second BrainStation course. Last summer I took the Product Management course on campus in Vancouver, BC and this summer I took the User Interface course online. They were both one night a week for 10 weeks. The quality of both courses... Read More was excellent. I like the 10 week format because I need time to really absorb what I am learning. The product management course is offered over 5 full time days (or was last year anyway) and I really don't think I would have learned as much. With the 10 week format there was enough time to actually do the homework each week. If you keep up with it one night a week of doing homework is enough, but for me it is hard to find time. I actually tried to do a 5 week accelerated program, the User Experience Design course, but I got sick and only went to 2 classes. Still that was almost half of the course and it was way too fast. I just barely got the homework done but didn't really spend enough time to absorb what I was doing. If you are used to taking courses and/or are not working full time you should look at the 5 week accelerated programs though. They are the exact same material as the 10 week ones, just twice as fast.My teacher in both of the courses I finished were really great. They were both working industry professionals with a ton of experience. One is a VP even! This was the part that I liked the best, they both shared a LOT of information in addition to the slides such as showing us real documents/designs/roadmaps/etc that they had worked on for various projects. Being able to see what the real work looks like really helped me understand the topics we covered in each lesson and also gave me confidence at work that what I was producing was the correct thing or in the correct format. Also both courses had teaching assistants and I liked both of them a lot too. It was good having two different instructors available because we got to hear two different experiences. The only downsides I can share is that the online course just had way too many people in my class but that is probably because it was the first session after the pandemic started. The 5 week course I started was also online but had 2/3 the number of students. But overall everyone is really great there. In fact I withdrew from that 5 week course halfway through and then was allowed to register in the UI course instead once I was no longer sick and that was As far as diversity goes I had 2 white instructors, an Indian instructor, a Black instructor, and an Asian instructor. All my instructors were men but in each of the classes I would guess half of the class was female. I know that there are female instructors also as I know a couple but my instructors were all men. All of the BrainStation employees I interacted with aside from teachers for all 3 courses were women. So I would say I interacted with an equal number of male and female employees at Brainstation and of all ethnicities. I really learned a lot in both courses and I 10000% have used stuff from these courses at work! I had to take on the role of Product Manager for 6 months at the planning phase of a new product while we looked for a full time PM and I was completely armed and prepared to do that. There were some bumps along the way, especially as I learned to translate the ""student project"" level of my knowledge into real business deliverables -- and learned how to make slide decks from scratch! (BrainStation final projects come with a template you can use if you want so you don't have to be great at that stuff to do the course) I can safely say that I outperformed expectations of me and I owe the credit completely to the Product Management course!The User Interface Design course that I took I finished it just recently after handing off the role of PM to our new permanent product manager. I took this one for me, not for work. I always had this mental block against graphics, I was convinced I couldn't do anything that involved graphics. So I decided to force myself through it by taking this course. Don't get me wrong, I struggled. This design stuff does not come to me naturally and although the software is pretty straight forward when there was something that I couldn't figure out it was really hard. Plus my designs were not great. But by the end of the course I was using the software and my designs were pretty good! I am not a natural talent, I'll need to keep working on it if I really want to get to a professional level, but where I'm at now is pretty good! The app I designed looked better than a lot of apps I've seen. I was pretty happy with what I learned and how much I grew and got over my fears in this course. There isn't a lot of instruction on how to use the programs nor how-to's on making designs/graphics themselves but instead the course teaches a lot about the theory of User Interface Design and you do designs as the course goes, working on your final project a bit each week, applying what you have learned. For some people that worked out well. For me it was hard because I spent a lot of time trying to learn the software. I ended up buying a $15 Udemy course on how to use sketch and I spent a week watching that. After I did that I found I was able to really apply what I was learning and doing the designs wasn't as frustrating (or pointless) as before.I am a mobile developer so I already had the code part but whenever I tried to make an app it was always extremely ugly. I'm really looking forward to using my design skills and product management knowledge to plan some apps!Read Less",brainstation,10571

Because of COVID, all courses were enrolling online anyways, so that made my decision a bit easier.Overall, I thought that the Springboard experience was outstanding: quality curriculum; supportive and highly responsive network of mentors, coaches and advisors; ability to move at your own pace (for me: fast). I loved that the curriculum not only covered practical UX skills, but also included career-building units to help you network and improve your resume, so you're ready to apply to jobs right after you complete the course. I had a wonderful mentor who shared his real-world UX expertise during our weekly meetings, and if I ever had a question or issue, the student advisor for my cohort was always available to help.

We had people that came from completely different backgrounds and had little prior programming experience. However, it's looking like Python &amp; Django are becoming more popular now and I wish we had some exposure to these frameworks as well. It appears that future aA cohorts will, in-fact, be going this route instead of RoR.2) While aA has a wealth of knowledge on App Academy Open - the main tool for content for our curriculum (it's where all of our projects, homework, and readings were housed), that portal is not very organized. If I wanted to go back and reference something we learned 4-5 weeks back - it was hard to find. I wish they made all the projects &amp; topics we covered searchable.To say that App Academy was intense is not an understatement. About 1/3 of our initial cohort didn't make it to the end. But it was very rewarding to have completed it.Read Less",app-academy,10525

We covered tons of material in 10 weeks, and she led us through this marathon with enthusiasm, encouragement, and great humor. Not only did she give us 110% percent during every class, she also met with many of us individually. Her advice and guidance were invaluable. This is a BrainStation strength—your instructors are industry professionals who are committed teachers willing to share their experiences. I also learned so much from my fellow students.

The TA's are amazing (from my cohort at least), they were knowledgable and past grads so they knew what it was like to be in our shoes. The curriculum readings need to revised and updated in a few parts, thankfully TA's are there to clarify. Before the cohort starts they have you learn the basics of Ruby since the beginning of the program is focused on Ruby. I highly suggest also taking time to learn some JavaScript as well. Because you get a lot of time with Ruby and then when JS time happens you'll feel like you just got thrown into the deep end. At the time of writing this review I am just finishing week 15 out of 16, getting ready to get into the career quest part (technically already started), which is also intense. Pretty much from start of the program until you get a job you will be working you butt off.

Your fellow cohorts will be some of your greatest resources and best friends, you will bond over struggling together and it's a great time to make networks (you never know what companies you or any of them will get into).

There are flexible payment options for those who need them, and the staff is simply amazing. Your student advisor is there to answer all your questions and ensure you succeed.

There are many niche avenues to pursue within UI/UX Design, and Springboard covers all of them. Why should you consider UX/UI Design as a career?

Read More I could not have learned what I did in this course without his help) - Additional mentor calls if necessary (these aren't with your mentor, but with a different mentor assigned by Springboard. I still found them helpful) - The structure of the course helps you really understand the basics and have a good foundation for the fundamentals of UX design - The Industry Design Project! Huge strong point. This will give you real-world experience which you can put on your resume and highlight on your portfolio - If you take the job guarantee, you're required to pass mock interviews at the end of the course: whiteboarding, portfolio walkthrough, and a behavioral interview. You get two chances to pass, but I passed them all on my first try and so did the other students I spoke with. As long as you prepare and practice you should be able to pass, but this is a strong point because it prepares you for the real-world interview process. I was really nervous for these but I'm very glad they're embedded into the structure of the course - I have just applied to complete with Springboard, so I haven't begun my job search yet, but if you take the job guarantee you will also have access to career coaches 6 months post-graduation, which will be incredibly valuable - My student advisor (Molly) was incredible - quick response from her when I reached out, and she went above and beyond to address my concerns and make sure I was taken care of Sticking points (for me personally): - The course ran a lot longer than I expected it to. The projected time to complete is within 6 months if you spend 20-25 hours a week on the course. It took me about 11 months to complete, and I think this is more due to the course structure than anything else. Projects build on other projects, so sometimes I had to revise certain projects before moving onto the next stage. For the lengthier projects, I had to revise multiple times and it took a few weeks to get the go ahead from my mentor to continue. Like I said, he was incredibly helpful to me outside of the normal hours we met and I don't blame him for this at all - I think it made me a much better designer and helped me to go into the material in more depth. My sticking point here is just wishing that Springboard projected closer to a year rather than 6 months (for part-time students like me), but this could be something that's unique to my experience - I understand why the career coaching sections are built into the structure of the course, but I have to admit I really did just want to focus on the hard skills of the course and found it a little jarring that there were career coaching sections in the beginning/middle of the course rather than just the end. The reason for this is networking and building up your LinkedIn profile/connections during the course, so the reasoning is good. I just struggled with feeling like I really wanted to focus on the skills themselves before doing the networking Overall, I had a really positive experience with Springboard and found that they were really helpful and responsive when I needed them to be. I haven't started my job search, but if I'm able to update this review later, I will when I have a better understanding of how that will look.

I was recommended by one of my Ph.D. student friends, who eventually successfully... Read More landed a good working position. I therefore decided to follow his footsteps.Overall: I am quite satisfied with Springboard's program. I think it has formed me well to become a data scientist and to quickly land a job. However, I believe there are a few things they can still improve on.Pros:- Overall Quality: the data science track definitely introduces and educates you well to the data science world, used in the industry. It covers most aspects of data science (wrangling, visualization, ML, ... ) and lets you acquire enough experience to land a job in that field. Of course, it won't replace extensive years of professional experience, but it is great way to bootstrap your data science career.- Preparedness: I would argue that the data science track doesn't require advanced programming skills, but it is best to have some Python experience (the software overwhelmingly used in the course). If you don't (like me), the first few months can be a bit of a learning curve. You eventually pass that stage though.- The Capstone Projects: the program is focused on two data science projects that you lead from start to finish. A great learning experience where you put your hands in the dirt, which you accomplish under the supervision of your mentor. These are great accomplishments you put in your portfolio and that you showcase to employers. - Mentorship: Speaking of which, the supervision by your mentor is probably the greatest feature of the course (and why the price is a bit high). For those who need someone to look over their shoulder, it's definitely a great resource that helps you move forward in the course. The mentorship I received was great and from what I heard, bad experience with mentors is quite rare. Plus you can always change, if it gets really bad.- Career: The career services they offer are equally useful. By helping you build your résumé, your LinkedIn profile, etc... Springboard helps you reach out and makes your profile more attractive to employers. The mock interviews you need to pass in order to complete the course are ideal reflections of real career situations.- Flexibility: While it is not something obvious when you start, you can actually ask for pauses, freezes and extensions if you need more time to complete the curriculum, or if you dealing with too much stuff a time in your professional / personal life (I assume they don't openly advertise that because they prefer you to finish the certification in a reasonable amount of time). I personally extensively used those (mostly because of how busy I was with my Ph.D. work, specially when it came down to my thesis defense). I eventually completed the program in 12 months. However, I DO NOT recommend to do so within such a big time frame. 6-8 months is definitely reasonable if you allocate the proper time each week. If you trail like I did, Springboard eventually starts charging you for additional extensions.Cons:- Rates: their rates are a bit high in my opinion and I believe it's mostly because of the number of resources they offer (mentors, career advisors, extensive curriculum, access to external resources like DataCamp). It's good to have that many resources, but in my opinion, some parts of the curriculum (maybe less than 10%) are useless or redundant. Therefore, I think the rates (assuming you avoid enrolling in paid extensions) could be 10% cheaper than what they currently are.- Customer Service: this definitely has been the worst part of the whole program. I assume it's because Springboard has considerably increased its volume of students (across all tracks) but their personnel's size hasn't keep up with the trend. While I always eventually obtained the information I requested, it takes a while to find and reach out to the proper person. First of, they only allow email communications. Then, their services are split between advisors, support team, finance team, etc... So if you ask for something to someone, they will most likely re-direct you to someone else. And the response time can be a few days. I don't expect every customer rep. to know everything and I assume it takes a while to train, but it is quite frustrating when you can't get a straight answer immediately, specially for finance-related questions or for deadlines (when you need an answer fast).Read Less",springboard,11035

You will spend only a few days on topics that are taught over a semester in college. At times, you are likely to be overwhelmed by the pace. On the flip-side, you are also likely to be too immersed to even think about it. It may feel like you are being rushed to cram new material each day, but you would be surprised to realize how much you are actually learning under the hood. In addition to the basic knowledge, you are learning how to learn new technologies quickly and effectively. This resourcefulness is probably the most valuable return on your investment of time, money and effort.

Our instructors had also set up a couple of minutes for closing thoughts, questions or potential 1:1 sessions. This provided an interactive session with the class rather than a full 3 hour lecture. Our class notes and assignments were already neatly packaged into jupyter notebooks, and are available in advance of each class; this allowed students to review class notes prior to the class.

The welcoming environment was nice, and the teachers spent countless hours teaching you how to solve problems, rather than just pointing to solutions. If you genuinely want to learn and have the drive to survive the 6 month long program, you will learn a lot of information. In addition to the price the lack of data structures and algorithm teaching is in part the draw back of all boot camps, there simply is not enough time to teach you everything.

Like so many other people around the world, I was challenged by the pandemic and lost my job due to covid.... Read More Learning about digital marketing had been in my mind for years now, but it was one of those things that I didn't pursue before because of time, routine, being comfortable at work, etc. The overall experience was very positive, starting with the learning advisors that made the time to answer every question I had and really walked me through the whole process step by step.  The program was fast-paced. I can't emphasize this enough. This is a challenging program that requires your full attention and dedication. I understand every student is different, but in my case, this was the only thing I was able to work on during those 3 months. Between lectures and working on my projects I probably spent around 60 hours per week. The program was challenging but in a very positive way. At first, I was a little bit intimidated by it, especially after 13 years since I attended school, but I was able to adapt very quickly with the support of my educators, my classmates, and family. I would define my overall experience taking this program as ""the perfect storm"", (right timing, right educators, and right classmates). The educators (Josh Muirhead and Justin Lowe) were amazing, both of them leaders in their area of expertise and now with a commitment to share their knowledge in order to help shape a new generation of digital marketers. Learning from them was one of the most rewarding experiences during this time. The instructors' styles of teaching were very different but in my opinion, I feel we received a very well-balanced learning experience. The content was relevant, the examples they used were always current with what's happening in the industry, and we were always encouraged to seek extra sources of information to stay updated with newer digital marketing trends.  The introduction of the capstone project wasn't only a perfect exercise to apply everything that we learned throughout the course but also the perfect output to start our own portfolio to use for potential job opportunities.  I could continue describing what my experience or my day to day was like during this time, but all I can say is that this was the best investment I've ever made.Read Less",brainstation,10571

These are the reasons why they are the best learning program in my book: -The learning experience is really engaging, they show practical examples as to the implementation of everything we learn. And that is something very hard to do. How can you keep students interested or motivated with very abstract and sometimes very difficult concepts? Well... the Practicum team has nailed the student experience. I am super motivated, happy and excited to learn, they make hard concepts digestible. -The team is constantly improving, they care about us, they support us, they listen to us. When I’ve encountered roadblocks, there has always been a human being on the other side, be it support inside the platform, or in slack, with the tutors, other senior students, the managers... even the code reviewers are there to help you. I love that I’m not alone in this journey. -The other thing I truly love about Practicum is the skill assessment. We get our projects reviewed every two weeks by industry professionals. THAT was a game changer for me, reviewers don’t tell you what to do. They explain why something is wrong, we have to put the effort to figure it out on our own. I find that very challenging at times, but at the same time is super rewarding. -We work on REAL projects from scratch. Moreover, we learn how to optimize them, how to scale them and the industry standards on how to do things. -We learn version control and even have sections dedicated to Git. -They won’t sell you stuff you don’t need. In fact they don’t sell you anything! -They don’t make promises they won’t fulfill. For me it is very important to get the value I seek. And Practicum has gone over and beyond anything I had expected. When they say they will teach you, they mean it! -Not everything is rainbows and unicorns... by this I mean the Program will really push you to improve, be it time management, project management, hard and soft skills. There have been times I’ve been in the verge of tears and exhaustion... but that is exactly why this program is truly worth it. Because it means you are growing. When I look back at the “easy” programs, I realized I didn’t know anything and my code was a complete joke.. all over the place. Now my programming is intentional and I’m amazed at how much I’ve grown. -There is structure and guidance every step of the way. Unlike other “bootcamps”, the team at Practicum really wants you to succeed, really wants you to participate, to ask questions, to challenge, to mentor others, to learn from others, to collaborate and communicate. That tells you the team at Practicum really cares. Give a try to their free introductory courses, you have nothing to lose and really much to gain.Read Less",practicum-bootcamp,11225

Read More in love with learning to code and wanted to know more. I was lucky enough to be able to leave my full-time job to dive into learning further. I started with self-learning through all of the free sites you have undoubtedly have heard of, but eventually felt like I was in a rut, constantly learning theory but not putting it into practice or knowing if I was doing it right! I discovered Practicum by Yandex through a Facebook programming group I had joined. I took the free introductory course for web development and flew through it. The promise of real world projects, actual reviews and a community to be a part of convinced me to sign up. I am so happy I did! One of the best things for me is now I have accountability. The course is split up into two week “sprints” that give me a goal to achieve, which is a great motivator for me. The sprints are made up of two parts. First is theory, which you read about and then immediately practice in exercises. I’m a hands-on learner myself, so practicing what I just learned in theory is so helpful. After the theory you work on a real world project. For these projects you learn how to use common development tools such as Figma, Github, VScode and will have a website of your own creation at the end. Your projects are reviewed by professional web developers who give further sources for you to research if needed and explain why something should be done a different way. We also have a live coding session for every sprint that further explains the theory and helps you see coding in action. If that wasn’t enough, there is a fantastic community of your fellow students set up on the chat program Slack. You are able to ask others who are working on the same project you are questions or get advice. It’s so nice to know I’m not the only one struggling with a problem or succeeding! You get practice in helping others if you can and there are senior students from other cohorts that help answer questions as well. On top of that, what I’ve found most helpful is my tutor. The tutor is there to answer your questions when you don’t know something but in a way that leads you to the answer instead of just giving you the solution outright. Also I can tell everyone on the Practicum team wants me to succeed. They give you countless resources and listen to your feedback. They want to improve the course for all students.

Read More college, I already found myself enjoying the prep material on App Academy's website more than my school stuff. Fast forward to my actual cohort, it was one of the most challenging educational experiences I had gone through. But because the instructors made things clear, were personable, and I was surrounded by other peers motivated to change theirs live, it really helped me persist. Every weekday I went to lectures, and afterwards would complete readings and homework, while studying for exams on the weekends. Doing readings before lectures was something I had never done in college, and App Academy helped me see the benefits in doing so, and I definitely reaped them as well. I say if you genuinely are curious about and have a passion for programming, your time at App Academy will be a positive and memorable one, despite its fast pace and challenging topics. The most important things I got out of App Academy were the computer science foundations, the jumpstart I needed to feel confident to learn on my own after my cohort ended, connections that I made from it, presentable projects, and how to present myself as a software engineer for the job search. I gained all this in the span of 4 months. Nothing is guaranteed, but App Academy definitely provides you the resources to get to where you want to be.

Read More salaries are QUITE high - You learn 2 languages, a frontend framework, 3 projects (2 solo, 1 group), and a bunch of other stuff Cons: - Sooooooooooo much work (your routine will be: Coffee, Lecture, Lunch, Work, Work, Dinner, Work, Sleep, Repeat for 16-weeks) Not TLDR: Hello World! - the beginning of your journey; if in fact you are new to this stuff like I was. Before App Academy, I had been a Host and a Server in the restaurant business for four years. When the pandemic hit I was out of a job and had to look for options. I live in San Francisco and a ton of people here are in tech and so I thought I'd check it out and see if it was for me. I took a two-week Jumpstart program with App Academy and there I learned Ruby - a cool language that flows like plain English; mostly. I was never great at math but have always been interested in languages. Learning to code is like learning a language. If you like that, try it out. When you're coding you're solving problems and trying to get stuff to work. It can be very gratifying! Jumpstart was a lot of fun for me and so I applied to App Academy. On my first try I hadn't practiced my skills enough but on the second try I did great! From the first day at App Academy know that you are in for a lot of work. In the morning, I think it was ~9-12:30 for me, you will have lectures with 1-2 5-10 minute breaks in-between. In the afternoon, ~1:30-5, you will be paired up with a fellow classmate to solve a bunch of problems mostly related to your morning lectures. The lectures will be based on your previous evenings material. Expect about 4-6 hours of studying every evening - I wish that were a joke but you've got a lot to learn in 16-weeks. You will do your partner and yourself the most good if you do your homework. Please, please, please, do your homework. When I graduated, it took me about 2-3 more weeks to finish up my final projects. After that you go into job search and you will continue to do tons of work so that one day, you will land an awesome job in software!! :)Read Less",app-academy,10525

Prepare to spend more time on certain project assignments to really make it stand out. Their recommended number of hours to complete units is based on what an average student would spend (roughly C+/B- work in my opinion) - Since your mentor will most likely be a working professional, they aren't always as responsive with replying to emails and also they most likely have up to 4 other mentees.

In fact, rather than going to stackexchange or googling for something, I often review... Read More my lessons from this class when I can't remember how to do something or am having trouble with the documentation. There's a lot of information available online that covers similar subjects, but the way Yandex presents it is just better. Especially with javascript, a lot of information can be old or outdated examples that use jquery, not the case for Yandex. They cover basically everything you need to know for the MERN stack: html/css BEM style flexbox/flexgrid javascript es10 (they do an especially good job here) react nodesjs expressjs babel webpack mongodb mongoose REST api modular programming Instructors: The instructors were one of the best parts of the program. I really like the staff and found them very helpful and easy to talk to. You could reach them over slack whenever you are having trouble on a project. Keep in mind, though, that most of them are based in Russia. For me, in Pacific Standard Time, I would usually do my work during the day and send it to be reviewed or to receive feedback if I was having difficulty with the project, and by the next day I would receive feedback from them that I could work on. If you have anything come up during the course and need to take a leave of absence, the staff is very flexible and accommodating. The projects were challenging, but their feedback was extremely helpful and even if you have done some programming before you will really improve a lot. There were clear deadlines for projects that were very reasonable. Job Assistance: There were a few lessons on common whiteboarding questions you might be asked during an interview. There was also an optional project for a real company that groups of 3-4 students could work on, which was an excellent learning experience. After graduating, there is a career acceleration program to help you find a job. Overall Experience: Overall this was exactly what I wanted out of a bootcamp program. I especially recommend it for people who have some background in programming already and want to improve, since you will be challenged and they will leave a lot of constructive criticism on your projects. It can also be challenging because it is a lot of information to cover, but the program is long enough to cover it all well, and you can always come back to the course material if you need to review.Read Less",practicum-bootcamp,11225

Read More international relations and communication/writing in my undergraduate career so had no formal quantitative experience upon applying. From the moment I applied to Springboard, everything was incredibly professional and straightforward. In fact, after submitting my application, a recruiter called me within 5 minutes to talk about my interest - completely opposite of another boot camp I was considering who didn’t even contact me despite confirming an appointment. This quickness made me think they were desperate, but the recruiter wasn’t pushy but friendly and even gave me an informal interview to make sure I was someone who really wanted to sign up. After that call, I was required to take a roughly one-hour long quantitative aptitude test to further verify that data analytics was a path I could reasonably pursue. I mention this because I was worried that I would fall trap to simply enrolling into a program that took anyone and everyone who signed up. In truth, I’m not sure if they decline students from enrolling either way, but I felt confident that this interview and assessment were evidence that they were at least slightly selective in their admissions process. Curriculum The curriculum is mostly a curation of online resources. These resources come from YouTube videos, articles, and other websites related to business and data analytics. A couple of units are specifically dedicated to business education like economics, financial analysis, statistics, accounting, and other business fundamentals. The cycle of the projects also follows that of a typical data analyst workflow, somewhat similar to the scientific method in crafting a hypothesis, gathering data, exploration, etc. I found these concepts helpful as I was someone who steered away from anything business-related up to that point; I simply had no interest back then. Most of the projects simulate a real-world project utilizing the things you learned earlier in the unit. These are not typically from online resources and are created by Springboard. Given that I don’t have real-world experience with these kinds of projects, it’s hard for me to stack them up against practicality, but they tended to help structure my capstone projects which require you to make up your own project and find the data for it, so it was helpful in that regard. Otherwise, sometimes the projects were poorly worded and it could be slightly cumbersome in finding out exactly what you were supposed to do. But these were usually minor and you could always clarify with your mentor or other students about the assignments and get clarification. They also release new versions of the curriculum to improve a particular assignment, section, or even whole unit based on student feedback so they really try to be responsive to what’s working and what’s not for students. Towards the final stages of the curriculum, you’re required to do a series of interviews that would mimic a real interview you would get. For example, you do a behavioral interview, a presentation interview in which you create a presentation from a project in the course and give that presentation as if you were “working” for the organization, and a technical interview in which they ask you questions about statistics, business, SQL, or whatever else might come up in a real technical interview. Your career coach helps you prepare for these, mostly the behavioral ones as they aren’t data specialists themselves but you can also do preparation with your mentor to prepare for these. They are pass/fail. You’re given a couple of opportunities to pass it but if you fail too many times then you have to redo a couple of units I believe. At first, I found this kind of scary, but the pressure it adds to those interviews is really helpful in simulating what it will be like when you’re doing real interviews. They tend to be anxiety-inducing, you’ll be nervous, and the stakes are higher. The fact that they try to build this pressure into these mock interviews was pretty cool now that I reflect on it. At the time I didn’t think it was that cool! But if you’re someone who struggles with interviews, these mock runs are helpful not only in getting practice but also feedback from those interviewers. They go into detail about how you could do better or other things to think about when you get to a real interview. Mentors and Community Each student is assigned a mentor who is a data analyst/scientist in the field. You have weekly calls with them and they’re mostly there to guide you through the curriculum but you can always talk to them about other things like job searching or how they use tools/techniques in their own jobs, etc; at least my mentor was open to talking about whatever. I hadn’t ever come across anyone who had a bad experience with their mentor, but it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. My mentor was incredibly relaxed, easy to talk to, and helpful when I needed help in the curriculum or needed encouragement on something I found difficult. One thing that made me like my mentor more was also his ability to sometimes question minor details in the curriculum. I appreciate someone who can point out weaknesses in something even though they’re part of the organization itself. It let me know that this person I was assigned to by Springboard wasn’t necessarily a 100% kool-aid drinking member of the club, but an independent person who, though still agreed the curriculum was a good one, was capable of sometimes saying “well I’m not sure I would do it that way but it’s valid.” Upon being accepted into the program, you are also invited to the Slack channel for your specific course. This is where you can communicate with other students in the course who are all at different stages of the curriculum, though you do have a channel for people who are in your specific cohort. There are also Springboard faculty in the channel as well, including a person who helped write the curriculum. They are really helpful in clarifying kinks in assignments or helping students who are having a difficult time on something. There are also various channels for different types of things like job searching, motivation, resources, recorded lectures, and all types of things. Throughout the curriculum, you also have career units in which you learn strategies about job searching. You’re also allowed to choose a career coach, who appears to be contracted with Springboard (I could be wrong about this) to provide 30-minute coaching sessions. These range from resume critiques, to mock interviews, to general strategies, to sharing resources, and really anything that they feel would be helpful to you. You also aren’t required to stick with one career coach, you can always select from a whole list of people at any point and they have descriptions of their background to give you a sense of what to expect. I stuck with the same one the entire time because I didn’t feel the need to talk to a different coach. The Job Search The job search process was not a totally pleasant one, as anyone who has gone through it can attest. But my career coach and the Springboard community in Slack were really helpful. You could see where other people were struggling as well and my career coach would always give helpful suggestions or resources to help in my search. I applied to a little over 90 jobs and had 3 total interviews. Again, I don’t have any kind of formal background in data, business, or STEM besides the Springboard certificate and some projects to showcase my aptitude, so I felt that that was a bit of a barrier for me. Despite this, I did get a job! A friend of my partner referred me to a role at her company which landed me the interview. My career coach did a mock interview with me, reviewed Google Docs that I drafted interview responses to, and answered any other questions I had during the process. I can honestly say my experience in the boot camp really gave me a leg up. They loved that I had that experience and projects to show for it. During the final round of interviews for this role, I had a technical assessment and didn’t do too hot on it, but I was able to redeem myself by talking intelligently about my projects in the course. I think this made me come across as someone who understood general concepts and use cases for specific things and even if I lagged on the technical assessment, I was someone who could get better quickly. My title isn’t “data analyst” but “marketing specialist.” Much of the role is data related though and even though some of it isn’t, it allows me to use skills that I’ve built over the years in undergrad and as a teacher so I’m not 100% shifted into a totally new technical profession. The other roles I interviewed for were pure data analyst jobs though. I made it to either the final or next to final rounds in those interviews and made some mistakes that I think cost me the job. You learn from these though, and your career coach will help you diagnose what happened and how you can do better the next time. I finished the course in mid-November and just recently got a job offer on March 29, so a little over 4 months after completing the course. Another cool thing that Springboard offers is post-completion assistance. You’re allowed to meet with another mentor who can help you be accountable for keeping your skills alive and building more projects to showcase to prospective employers. You have access to this mentor until you get a job and can be really helpful when you complete the course and then start to find that your skills are slipping. A Potential Downside One potential downside to this track might be the curriculum. Though this downside is innate in the way the course is structured. It’s set up as a part-time, 6-month learning experience. They want you to get familiar with a wide range of tools that you could potentially use in a data analyst job, mostly the more popular ones as there are TONS of tools that you could potentially use in the field. In this regard, there’s more breadth than depth in the things you’ll learn. They are still helpful. After a unit and a project, you can honestly say that you’re proficient in that tool or concept. You’ll also learn that each tool could be its own 6-month course. If you haven’t used Microsoft Excel professionally before, or maybe you have, you find out that Excel is more powerful than what you were familiar with. This was the case for me anyway. I’m not sure that any boot camp can really overcome this downside though when the curriculum itself is designed to be completed in a relatively short period of time. You might become interested in diving deeper into a tool after completing a unit on it, but have to move on to the next tool introduced in the next unit. This is just part of being in tech. I recommend seeking other online resources if you become really interested in getting better at a particular tool. However, I still believe, along with many other practitioners, that the curriculum is still helpful in allowing you to understand the essentials and then get a job with them. In Conclusion I think the number one thing that you get out of the course is structure and community. Of course, you could learn everything in any boot camp online for free, but you to be someone who can muster the discipline and structure to stick to it long-term. I have a habit of constantly looking for new resources to learn from, even after finding what seems like a good one, I’ll complete half of it and then start looking for something else. Springboard’s curriculum allowed me to stay on course and I trusted that what they put in front of me was going to be helpful in learning and ultimately getting a job. The frequent connection with my mentors, career coach, and other students was really helpful in knowing that I wasn’t alone. It gave me a psychological edge in that someone I was meeting with at the end of the week was expecting me to complete assignments and be able to discuss them. This was a total career pivot for me and, so far, I’m glad that I did it. I welcome any questions about my experience and the program!Read Less",springboard,11035

Read More the deciding factor to why I chose Springboard over other bootcamps. I have always wanted to have someone guide me and become my mentor.

Without the help of a mentor, I would've struggled. All of my questions about design were answered by my mentor and now it's engrained into me. The Springboard community (people who work there aka. community managers, career coaches, and student advisors) are very supportive and is always wishing the best for you. I learnt so much within 6-7 months. The cons: In the very beginning, I underestimated the amount of work that would go into this program. It took a lot out of me and there were multiple times I burned out. I put a lot of importance in the Industry Design Program and I was disappointed. Most companies that you get matched up with probably would not use your designs at the end (I know some students have had their designs implemented). This all comes down to the company as most do not have the financial budget to hire someone to implement your designs. But maybe they will in the future. Besides the IDP, I noticed that sometimes the Springboard community of other students communicating with each other is quite dead silent. People in the beginning were very active and now it's like there are crickets in some channels. Overall, I would recommend Springboard as they do a great job preparing you to become a designer and to find a job!

Read More of the curriculum is actually videos and articles from other online resources (see ""Cons"" below). But they make up for this by their mentorship program (see ""Pros"" below). On the surface, this looks like a really good deal--it's cheaper than other bootcamps, it's self-paced, and you get a tuition refund guarantee if you don't find a job within 6 months of graduating. However, in practice, when you have a 6-month deadline (instead of in-person classes with an instructor to keep you accountable on a daily basis), it can be really easy to fall behind. Fortunately Springboard has a number of student advisors and other support staff who can help with setting a schedule for you to follow and giving you extensions (both of which I've used). But I think the people who can best thrive in this kind of program are those who can set clear goals for themselves on a weekly basis, in spite of all the other things going on in their lives. I had a lot of trouble balancing my bootcamp assignments with my daytime job and family obligations (your job and familial needs will feel very immediate while the bootcamp feels less urgent because of the 6-month deadline), and I quickly fell behind and needed extensions. This might all sound very obvious, but it's something that I and others I know often overlook. If you're not the kind of person to set hard deadlines for yourself, don't do a self-paced bootcamp. But if you are, and you don't mind not having an in-person instructor, then Springboard is for you. Pros: The mentorship program is the highlight of this bootcamp. Every student is matched with a mentor who they meet with once per week, 30 minutes at a time. You can also schedule additional unlimited 1:1 mentor calls with any mentor that's available, but I've found my weekly mentor to be the biggest help. I was able to ask my mentor for guidance on capstone projects, discuss questions I had about the mathematics behind certain algorithms, and ask for career advice (they are people in the industry, so they have insight on the field and job searches and whatnot). Springboard also has career coaches to help us with job searches, but it's still helpful to hear directly from the mouth of a person in the industry. Cons: Much of the curriculum is material that you can find on your own online (like articles on medium.com). Springboard organizes it all into a nice package for you, with many of their own project assignments sprinkled throughout, but this can make some of the material feel disjointed since it's a conglomeration of many different sources put together. Springboard goes through many updates with their curriculum though, so they've been making improvements to their assignments and curricula.

This is evident by the consistent stream of new features added to the education platform as well as the development of new roles, groups, and events all geared towards creating a more robust education for the students. The cost of this course is a fraction of the cost of other programs. Ultimately, you're probably looking at this review wondering: does this program work? While I'm still a student, I can offer some perspective. There are people in my cohort who have not passed certain modules and have needed to take a hiatus and join a later cohort. There are also people in my cohort who have already gained employment while taking the course. This should communicate two things: 1) This course isn't a freebie. It's hard. Not everyone who enrolls will pass. You will need to learn and apply yourself in order to progress. 2) If you apply yourself and progress you will learn the skills you need to learn to gain employment in the industry. Who do I recommend this course to: - Someone who is both willing and able to dedicate themselves to the process - 25+ hours a week - Someone looking for a remote course with an active community - Primary interactions occur via slack and zoom, with plenty of facetime if you want it or no facetime if you don't. - Someone looking for a program that charges prices that accurately reflect the value of the education. - $5,000 as of April 21st, 2021 - Someone looking to dive deep into front-end web development - You will graduate with a solid foundation in Front End Web Development and an understanding of Back End Web Development. — 1) Staff have a vested interest improving your level of knowledge and the quality of your education 2) Two-week sprint format (a few days of theory similar to the free course with a project due by the end of the sprint) accurately reflects a workflow common in the industry 3) Projects help practice and ingrain skills learned in the theory portion of the sprint. 4) Reasonably cost for a quality education. 5) Plenty of optional extra curriculars to interact with student from your cohort as well as the rest of the program. 6) Interacting with students from all over the world — 1) No in person offerings as of yet 2) Given the global nature of the community, it may be difficult to find times to interact with your peers. With Practicum-wide events becoming more available, this increases the likelihood of meeting peers. 3) Everyone creates the same projects, for the most part. This is meant to allow tutors to be able to give guided instruction to all, and to allow code reviewers to provide more in depth assistance. This works, the practice is real and the feedback is helpful. The projects display deep levels of knowledge. If you want to create a project that will be the pinnacle of your portfolio, however, you will need to do that on your own. 4) The program is young!

Additionally, there are periodic coaching calls to make sure your resume, portfolio, and social media are coming along with your course progress.

Read More friends and family during this year, and was able to focus on it full time for half of the program. The nine-month program isn't laid out with an accurate time frame.

2350,278597,0,,2021.0,0,Software Engineer I,Software Engineering Career Track,4.7,5.0,5.0,4.0,"I was an accountant for 6 years and decided I was unhappy in it so I pursued Software Engineering for better work/life balance (among other things). I did Springboard from March 2020 - May 2021 (took multiple breaks). I started applying to jobs on May... Read More 30, 2021 and only interviewed with 1 company (1 phone screen and 1 virtual onsite) and received/accepted an offer yesterday, June 17, 2021, as a Software Engineer I. What convinced me to choose Springboard (in order of importance to me): 1. Flexibility - While I would rather go to an in-person classroom style bootcamp, I didn't want to do those 3-month intensive bootcamps where I had no time for anything else. Springboard provides remote learning and therefore, this teaching model wasn't affected by COVID (I applied in Feb 2020 and started in March 2020) and even prepares you for a remote job afterward, if that's your goal. 2. Instructor is good - If you want to see if you like his style, take Colt Steele's Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp course or check out his Youtube channel. 3. Job guarantee - if you don't get a job within 6 months (I think with COVID, it's now a year) of graduating the course, you get a full refund. Be aware there are still requirements to follow in order to qualify to get the refund. 4. Accountability - weekly 1:1s with a paired mentor who is a professional in the industry 5. The topics the bootcamp covers are pretty extensive 6. Price - Given the amount of material, support, and timeframe, the price is way better than those 3 month intensive bootcamps. I chose the month to month payment plan, but if you can afford it, just pay upfront. After taking the course, here are my pros/cons: Pros: - Flexibility (see above) - Accountability - I had a really great and supportive mentor throughout the entire course. However, you can switch mentors if you want. - Multiple Break Options - Pause(s)/Freeze for when life gets abnormally busy or you need a break from the course. Both options push your deadline date. - 2 Live Code Reviews with mentors who are not your regular mentor - Really supportive student advisers, who can be an extra accountability point - Semi-weekly office hours (curriculum-related and general questions for student advisers as well) - recorded so you can reference whenever - There's a lot of material and you get so much practice with tons of projects and exercises with ""further study"" sections - 10 assessments that are reviewed by your mentor + 2 capstone projects - TAs are available via chat during normal business hours - Career office hours (go over topics related to resume, Linkedin, networking, etc.) - recorded so you can reference whenever - 8 career coach calls/check-ins - Placements team to help send job opportunities to your inbox closer to when you are completing the course (I believe this team was created in 2021) - They care a lot about their students - They ask for a lot of feedback from students and will make changes or improvements that make sense. - Everyone is so nice and supportive Cons: - Interview readiness: Interviewing was probably what I felt least prepared for at the end of the curriculum. If you are making the switch into software engineering, you need to know now that interviewing is a whole different ballgame than the actual job itself. Some software engineers go to interviewing bootcamps JUST to prepare for interviewing. It's one thing to know how to code and problem solve, but to also be able to talk through your thought process AND have your code work or have to figure out bugs in your code while someone is watching -- interviewing can be really stressful. I was super lucky because I have a software engineer friend that practiced with me every night for 1.5 months to help me prep for the MOCK interviews, and I ended up still not passing my first attempt at the coding mock interview (I think I had been practicing with my friend for a month already at that point). In addition to practicing with my friend, I even scheduled 1 practice mock interview with Springboard before attempting and ultimately passing my second official coding mock interview. FYI if you don't pass within 2 tries, you no longer qualify for the job guarantee - so at the time, it felt like high stakes to me. However, this shouldn't have been the focus (see Tips below). I also understand that not everyone has a friend that they can practice with every night and get valuable feedback (yes, I know she's a very good friend), so I think Springboard needs more support in this area where students can choose to practice with a live person however many times they want, in advance, to prepare for the coding and white-boarding mock interviews. - Pretty new curriculum, including policies and procedures: At least at the time that I started, they were still figuring out kinks/bugs in the curriculum so the exercises could change shortly after you do them (this happened to me) but there wouldn't be any notification about it. Now that they have hired more people, the communication is better about this sort of thing. While the changes can be annoying, this is also a good thing because that means they care about their curriculum and students and are always looking for ways to improve. They have also made a lot of updates and come out with new documentation around their policies and procedures. You as a student just need to go with the flow. - Every time you have a question or have a bug that you can't figure out, uploading your code to Google Drive or GitHub and then having to type out your issues/questions to the TA in a little chat box can be really annoying but this also gives you training on what it's like to work remotely - Although, I think in work settings, it's more likely that you would be able to have a quick meeting and share your screen. I know Springboard is trying to work on a solution to this, but this also isn't the end of the world. I can see that it's probably much easier to ask a question in person/be in a class setting for when you do have questions. - No new friends (at least for me): You don't really get to know your cohort that well unless you take initiative and be really social online - but to put it bluntly, I'm older and I'm not doing this to make friends haha. Everyone in my cohort/online did seem really nice and I knew people in my cohort who made individual study groups or paired up, but this just wasn't my thing ONLY because I already had a friend who was taking the UI/UX bootcamp with Springboard (she was probably ahead of me by 6 months) and we were each other's accountability buddies, and that was really helpful. Even after she graduated, we could keep each other accountable on her job search and my progress with Springboard. I understand that this is rare though so if you want to socialize and make study groups with your cohort, by all means, do that. Tips: - I'm not sure if this is still the case, but when I enrolled they let us access the curriculum 2 weeks before our cohort start date, and the deadline to decide if you want a refund is 2 weeks after the cohort start date. This is basically 1 full month where you get access to the curriculum to try it out. If you're on the fence about choosing Springboard and you're not in a rush to do the bootcamp, enroll in a cohort date late enough so that you get this 1 month trial. - Keep in mind that the point is to NOT get a refund, the point is to get a job with your new awesome skills. - With self-pacing learning, it's important to stay disciplined but stay healthy. Stick to a schedule. Turn off distractions. Make sure to eat well, drink water, exercise, and get plenty of sleep. You can't perform your best if your health goes down the drain. This is for your mental health too. - Take breaks if you need them! - If you don't think the weekly 1:1 mentor calls are enough, get an accountability buddy - could be from your cohort or could be a friend. - Reach out to your student advisor because they are super helpful and can keep you accountable too. - Career changes are DIFFICULT! Find your ""why"" and remind yourself of it when you're feeling unmotivated. Or better yet, look at it every day or week. - Do your best. Don't give up. Keep a positive attitude. It's a marathon, not a sprint. If you fall down, get back up again.Read Less",springboard,11035

This to me, is so important for sustaining motivation to complete the program. 2)It is highly hands-on and project oriented. This is a good thing, always a good thing, and Springboard recognizes that. Almost every unit has at least one mini-project to explore the content covered in that unit within an implementation context. You also need to complete two Capstone projects of your choice in any areas of your interest as part of the curriculum, and these projects are great for your Github or your resume. Clearly, Springboard appreciates that project-oriented learning is essential to drive certain concepts home and again, sustain motivation by seeing the fruits of your labor. 3)The quality of the resources. Data Science experts on the Springboard Team have put in efforts to create high quality resources - both technical and career-oriented. These are usually well-drafted informational documents or videos. They also handpick a good selection of public articles/videos (and even one wonderful book) to supplement your learning, and their partnership with DataCamp (shoutout!) gives you access to a rich library of also high quality content. 4)Flexibility Look, Springboard gets that life happens, and they've got your back. There is an option to take a 2-3 week pause from the course ANYTIME to perhaps catch up on other responsibilities or to maybe just *recharge*. Also, they offer a free 2 month extension to finish the program if you don't finish within the original 6 months, which can also turn out to be quite a blessing. I'm a full-time CS student at UCLA, so when I ran into a difficult quarter, I could still manage because of their flexible options. 5)Community You're assigned a Student Advisor and Mentor as part of the program, and in my experience, they were both wonderful. The Student Advisor regularly checks in on you if you need help making goals, being productive, planning a schedule, tackling burnout, and more! They really help keep you afloat during your journey. You meet with your mentor on a weekly basis so they can guide you with projects and difficult material, or tell you more about the industry and their type of work, which is always interesting to hear! My mentor was super helpful with his feedback on my projects and helped me shape them into something I was proud of. I should also mention that support on their Slack is pretty good too for Q/A related things, their customer support team is extremely friendly and helpful, and their cohort of career coaches are also excellent, so be sure to make regular appointments with them because they give extremely valuable and insightful advice about the industry and building the professional profile you want for yourself.

The Springboard workload is a lot like that, but for the duration of six months. The student advisors help you along, though, and you get 3 pauses that can be up to 3 weeks long.... Read More The curriculum covers everything. I had some knowledge of UX going in, but the bootcamp filled in the gaps I had in user research, data synthesis, and design planning while allowing me to practice and level up the skills I already had. The curriculum was a great curation of reading, lectures, and interactive lessons. Maybe I wish there were a few more lectures to break up the heavy reading units, but that’s nitpicking. On your first week, you get paired with a mentor who helps you apply your learning to a steady stream of projects. My mentor was great. She always had an insight or a resource to guide me and never got frustrated when I struggled or fell behind. You aren’t graded in the traditional way. You review project progress with your mentor, and they give you feedback to make changes. It’s technically pass/fail, but in practice, it trades the stick and carrot for a kind of conversation that results in the best possible portfolio. Online learning is a different animal than in-person learning. You have to be good at managing your time and staying focused. If you need the social element of a classroom, digesting lessons over Slack with your peers is a poor substitute. Communication on Slack felt transactional. I did make a good friend toward the end of the curriculum on a team project, but I wish Springboard did more to make student interaction meaningful early on. I’m sure there are a few hiring managers that would prefer to get a UX designer fresh out of Pratt, but Springboard does one thing better than any college I’ve ever heard of: career support. It’s part of the curriculum. They teach you how to build your network, a resume, a portfolio, then teach you how to interview and negotiate. It’s not just something you quietly know you should be doing in the background; they properly teach you and provide feedback as you create each artifact.

I appreciate every aspect of the course: the design of the learning platform, the community support, the projects I worked on, and the people I've got to know. I can't say enough good things about the course. There are two things I'm most impressed by the course. One is the comprehensive support we had. The community manager, instructors and tutors are there really supporting the students to get the most out of the course. I'm not sure how they did it but the platform online support is 24/7! Whenever I got stuck with a task, I sent an inquiry via the platform tech support, the response is almost straightaway from real people, despite all the time differences. That's very impressive and helpful! Another is the opportunity to work on projects for real companies. These are the most challenging because the data we worked with are a lot more complex in terms of both structure and sources, and there are lots of contextual factors to take into account in the process of analysis as well. So the learning never stops, and working on these projects to help the companies to achieve their business goals has been very rewarding experience. In brief.

In a nutshell... The program is amazing. The work is hard. There is never enough time. You’ll meet amazing... Read More people and build an awesome network. The TAs are what you are really paying for and are great. The intent behind their propriety tools (that are a WIP) can be clearly seen and it’s got a bright future. The online course is best for individuals that have other responsibilities and being in person has the added value of others being in the room to help motivate you to get the work done. The only thing I will harp on is that their current communication tools used for peer and TA chats are in rough shape. The folks who started the program didn’t know how big it would get and initially invested in Slack… which if you ask any current employee at a/A is the bane of their App Academy existence. Because a/A leaves their Slack channel open to Alumni (great intent!), the amount of users has grown to a point where it wouldn’t make financial sense to pay monthly per user (didn’t think about scale from the get go). From a business perspective, I agree that it would be a poor decision to pay monthly and it’s a band aid solution for now… but from a student perspective this was one of the biggest resource failures in the course as I have no history of chats from TAs or colleagues from as little as just 3 days ago. I understand the current situation and I also implore App Academy to find a more permanent solution ASAP. Having gone through the course and used many different comm tools in my career… I can’t tell you how many question threads were posted in Slack… and if it’s one thing slack is terrible at it’s threading conversations. All that being said… I’ll focus on the Parent perspective below. Firstly… parents take the one online course. It the only option that gives you the flexibility to be with your family if an emergency arises. I’ll also say that if you are a single parent with 100% physical custody and don’t have support to help watch your children… this program is probably not for you. Emphasis on ‘single parent’ and the requirements needed to be the superhuman you already are. There is a high probability that you will fail out of the program or stretch yourself too thin to be able to take care of, let alone spend time with your kid(s). IMO you will NEED support from your partner/support network for childcare. In fact, I’d start budgeting for the best “Thank You” gift you can think of before you even start the program. The balance is critical and allows for you to complete the program and spend quality time with your kids. If you have a partner in house to help… I’d be very clear about setting the expectation that they will become the primary caregiver, with you seeing your kids for meals and weekends. Did I mention you’re going to have to REALLY say thank you to your partner for helping out as much as he/she will? If you have a joint custody agreement… I advise trying to switch to a schedule where you get your kids on Friday and Saturday only. Saturday is the only day of the week where NOTHING is App Academy related. On Sundays you’ll be studying for your assessments. To end on a brighter note… I’m proof that it could be done. I had my kiddo on Thursday Night, Friday Morning and Night, and Saturday Morning… and it was doable. Barely… but doable. In fact, I had to project defer over Spring Break (which happens to coincidentally have been my project week) so that I would be able to show up for my family. Parenting and doing this program definitely tops the list of one of the hardest things that I’ve ever had to do. There’s also a great a/A Parent group that’s really helpful for support. They meet every two weeks or so. I highly suggest joining and even more so, suggest practicing to reach out to these peers because they are the only ones who can truly understand what it means to be a parent. Hope all that helps! In the end, I DO recommend App Academy. My gut says that it will only get better as they learn and time goes on. Good luck!Read Less",app-academy,10525

In fact, my general work experience was 3 years at... Read More Mcdonalds, then 7 at a Resort as a bartender. -Spent 30-50 hours a week studying. 10-20 hours a week working on my resume, cover letter, connections, and job searching. -Got a job offer and accepted an entry level Data Scientist position at about 4-5 months into the program. Currently still in after 3 months, love it. Pros: -Springboard itself is great and has a lot of the materials needed to learn the basics of DS. The reading/videos/coding can be tiresome at time, but just take it one step at a time and you'll near the end eventually. Take good notes and read every single line, do as much as the coding as you can but don't spend too much time on it, spend more time on your capstones as these are what will probably make or break your chances of landing a DS position. Make a daily/weekly schedule to make sure you complete the program on time. I recommend 5-7% completion every week, at least for the first couple of months. It will get harder as you go and you will suffer burnout too. But if you could accomplish more early on when you're still full of energy, then you'll have some room to slow down or take a break later on in the course if needed. -Mentors are smart and always there if you need something -Career coaches are great. I recommend getting to know them early on as I feel like besides learning the DS skills itself, this part of the program was the most beneficial. Unfortunately, if you're like me with a not so pretty background, the coaches might hit you with some reality that you will most likely become a Data Analyst first before ever becoming a DS. But if you run into one that truly cares, they can help you out so much. I attribute my current DS position to my career coach's help. So while all the career coaches are great and helpful, if you can find one where you see that they truly care about you and your job search, I recommend making a connection with that person and making as much calls to them as possible. -Cost is relatively doable for the bootcamps I've looked at so far. The payment options are nice as well -Customer service is excellent and quick to answer any questions Cons -Not sure if this is a true con, but many of study materials are free or attainable with a subscription fee. But that can be said about most schools too so. What's great is the structure and how one can learn the materials through repetition even though the beginning may be quite confusing. -Signed up for DS career track, but was told by many, except one, that I will most likely land a DA role before getting a DS position. Although that one person did help me beat the odds and get a DS position even though I've no true experience. But this is rare apparently, and requires dedication. -There's not too much cons about Springboard itself.... Overall, if you stick to Springboard and can push yourself then you'll succeed. Springboard is a great bootcamp that helped launched my career and can yours as well.Read Less",springboard,11035

The curriculum is structured like a real tech company where you train on the platform for a week or two and work on a project the next week. After completing the first free sprint, I was hooked. I fell in love with the platform so much that I was coding at any free time I have. If your goal is to learn to code for real, think like a data scientist or analyst, then Practicum by Yandex is for you. My favorite part of the program is the project and code review.

It’s usually scheduled in the afternoon US Pacific timezone For those who are wondering if you can manage the program, my suggestion would be to try out the Data Science Prep Course. During the course of selecting which education provider to go for, I’ve tried the prep course from a few bootcamp providers. It was the early interaction with an industry mentor that convinced me this learning journey is worthwhile.Read Less",springboard,11035

But Springboard does the work of finding the materials for you and they also provide you with access to member-only paid subscription items. For example, you get access to Medium articles, BitesizeUX, usability testing tools and a full year of Sketch of Adobe XD. Pacing and motivation to learn can be challenging for some.

2454,280850,0,,2021.0,1,Software Engineer,React,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Thank you, AAL, Egyptian government, and Udacity for providing me with the scholarship to enroll, participate and to learn React. Without this scholarship, it's practically impossible for me to enroll in Udacity React Nanodegree Program, not to talk of... Read More learning React with Udacity because I don't have a job, no source of income, no business and no investment of any kind. Back to the question: How's the program going? Well, I must confess that this program is awesome! It's going on smoothly with my end, as expected. At the beginning, when I first started the program, I became frustrated, confused and annoyed with myself. Why? Because the course was too complicated for me. I'm a novice when it comes to React. But when I started watching the videos and reading the documentations, downloading and watching other video tutorials from YouTube, and studying React documentations very well, the course became much more easier for me to comprehend, and I was able to follow up with the instructor. Back to the question: How has it matched my needs and expectations? Great question! I've been expecting Udacity to ask me this question before now. But thank God that you ask. The Udacity's React Nanodegree Program has influenced my life positively! At Udacity, you will not only be given challenges such as quizzes, and exercises to solve; and projects to build, but you will also be thought how to think. That's one of the things this program has done to me. It has change my perspective-the way I used to view problems before as something that has no solution. But this course has thought me to be viewing every problem I encounter in life as temporary challenge that can be solved. And Udacity has taught me how to think through every challenge, and proffer solutions to them-every challenge has solution which can be done in different ways. This program really matched my needs and expectations via the Udacity's features that this program provides, which include: (1) The Course Curriculum The learning program is flexible, not rigid. The course curriculum is designed in a way that is tailored to my busy life. It gives me the opportunity to learn at my own pace, and reach my personal goals on the schedule that works best for me. I usually invested a minimum of 6-8 hours a day to study the course. Meaning that I usually spend 42 - 56 hours per week, working on this React course. And the program is offline, and those not have a specific time that is fixed to study the course in a day. The course is splilted into 3 category : React Fundamentals In this category, I learn React's component models, with which I was able to write declarative, composable user interfaces to build production-ready apps. React and Redux When my app's state becomes difficult to maintain, I now know that it's time to add Redux! In this section, I learn Redux-how to manage complicated state to build enterprise-level apps. React-native In this lesson, I learn the fundamental differences between web and native applications as well as the main differences between React and React Native API. Along the lesson, I take a glimpse at the differences between developing for IOS and Android as well. Unlike the other lessons, I found this one confusing and frustrating sometimes. The part about the AsyncStorage API, which was a React Native version of localStorage, is outdated. The course material provides references to an implementation of it that was deprecated. For now, you can still use the implementation that they teach you at the course, but you will get this warning “AsyncStorage has been extracted from the react-native core and will be removed from a future release. It can now be installed and imported from ‘@react-native-community/async-storage’ instead of ‘react-native.” Another outdated part I would like to point out in this Udacity React Nanodegree review is about React Navigation. At least this time the course material does mention that an updated version of React Navigation was released, but the videos in the course cover the older version of it. So, when you watch the videos you have to go through the documentation to see how the same thing is done in the newest version. The other confusing and frustrating part of this lesson is about local notifications. Expo’s latest version changed the Notifications API syntax, so if you install its latest version, which you probably will, and follow the course material, you might get confused. In conclusion, this lesson was disappointing to me. Taking into consideration the price of this course, in this lesson I had to put down the course material and explore the documentation more than I expected. All I'm saying in essence is that in this course, I have been able to get real employable skills. The curriculum is designed with top-tier industry partners, not academics, so I learn the high-impact skills that top companies want. (2) Project-based, active learning In this course, I learn by doing with real-world projects (React Fundamentals-MyReads; React Redux-Would You Rather; and in React Native-Mobile Flashcards) and other hands-on exercises that lead to real skills mastery. In MyReads project I create a web application that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. What I like the most about the Udacity projects is that they explain what you need to do and then they give you the Project Rubric, which is kind of your guidelines to see if you met all the project’s specifications. Additionally, there is a step-by-step guide for building the app with a planning stage and a coding stage. If you are lost and don’t know where to start or what to do next, this guide will give you a direction to follow. Let me make it clear in this review of Udacity’s react nanodegree that it is not a tutorial where the instructor develops all the features in videos and you kind of code along. You have to do it all by yourself. In project 2: Would You Rather, I build a web app that lets the user play the “Would You Rather?” Game, answering and asking questions in the form “Would you rather A or B?”. This project helps me solidify what I’ve learned of React and Redux in a fun and creative way. It took me less time to develop this one, I think it was approximately 1 week. It was less stressful as well because you can look at the “Chirper” project and the lesson’s material when you are not sure how to implement a concept. In Project 3: Mobile Flashcards, I build a mobile application ( IOS or Android – or both) that allows users to create decks and a collection of cards in each deck. In each card, the user enters a question and an answer for that question, saving it to the correspondent deck. Whenever he/she wishes to revise the content of a deck, he/she can start that deck’s quiz. This project is a great opportunity to practice the parts of the lesson that was confusing or outdated, such as the react-native-community AsyncStorage implementation, the React Navigation latest version, and the Expo Notifications latest syntax. I develop this application for both IOS and Android because there are some differences between the platforms that are important to be aware of, not only in terms of design or user experience but in terms of the implementation of the functionalities as well. As in all the Udacity assessment projects, they give you a Project Rubric to make sure your solution meets all the required specifications before you submit it to the technical review. This serves as kind of guidelines to me to see if I meet all the project's specifications. I love this one as well. (3) Project review and Project feedback from experienced reviewers of Udacity’s React Nanodegree The project reviews are one of the differentiating aspects of the Udacity course. I found them very useful and professional, not to mention the boost of confidence you get in your projects knowing that someone sanctioned your work. (4) Learn on your schedule Udacity courses are all self-paced learning - whenever and wherever you want. I'm so much excited that I can now graduate while learning part-time for 10 hrs/week, at least. (5) Technical mentor support The help you need, when you need it. Reach out to Udacity's mentors 24/7 and have your coding questions answered quickly so you can keep learning. I used the Mentorship a couple of times when I was stuck in one of the projects. There is a platform called Knowledge where you can search for answers to questions similar to yours or post new questions related to your project or lessons. I didn’t post new questions because what I was looking for was already there. The solution I found there helped me move on. (6) Student community which is now highly improved. (7) Career services I’ll have access to resume support, Github portfolio review and LinkedIn profile optimization that help me advance my career and land a high-paying role. With all these features at Udacity, I have been transformed from an old me (novice in React Native) to a new me (a professional React Native developer) with high level of thinking.

It also allows you time to circle back to old projects and improve them and really let your brain be the awesome sponge it is and absorb all it can.

As the title says, If you stick with Springboard and really actively try to improve your skills, I got a job before I even finished the program with my new skills (and a good one at that). Pros: - My mentor was my absolute lifeline and made the program feel ""real"" which for me, as someone who avoids social activity at all cost, was huge because I had to talk to her weekly making sure I had something I could bring to her to talk about every week. Basically, I'm the kind of person who goes ""all-in"" on something for like two months and then forgets about it and drops it, my mentor was the core component of that not happening. - The support system is great - Sometimes I think things like career coaches, mentors, etc. are overrated, but I was surprised at how much value I actually got from these mandatory meetings I would have otherwise passed on. Room for improvement: - My IDP (real job experience) wasn't great, but Springboard staff was extremely helpful in navigating the situation, I would say my IDP experience was more or less a rare experience and other Springboard students seem to have had a great one. I wouldn't really expect to get a job from the IDP if you had any hopes in that. However, the career coaches at the end of the program will be very helpful to you in finding a job so no worries there. I would say, even if you don't have the best IDP experience, it's still job experience to put on your resume which is huge. - Its very easy to just say you completed the reading by checking the box without actually doing it, I would love to see some sort of short quiz that verifies you went over the material incorporated into the program even if it isn't graded, just some sort of feedback to myself that I should go back and read more carefully. In Summary: I've talked to other people from other bootcamp programs who don't have nearly as good outcome as springboard.

Initially, the admission counselors told me that the course would be completely achievable within 6 months while continuing to work, which cemented my decision. The course is laid out in way that really grounds you in the concepts of UX and leads you through step-by-step.

Not only are there mentors for the curriculum, but for your career search too. And the Slack community allowed me to connect with plenty of other students where we could examine each other's work, commiserate about our projects, and give us a better sense that we're not doing this alone. For me, the negative of the course was the time estimate for how long the course would take. To be fair, I may be an 'over-worker' and putting more time and effort into some projects than was necessary, but I finished the course nowhere near the 6-month mark that was originally pitched. I was working on the course while working a remote job at the same time, and I finished the course nearly 4 months after my original end date. To Springboard's credit, they do have safety nets for those in my position. Because I could show I was actively working and had the support of my mentor, they had some extensions available for people in my situation. Thankfully, I was able to complete the entire course within the extensions that were available without having to pay for extensions or losing my job guarantee. Ultimately, I feel that the course has given me the tools and the mindset to enter into this new career and actually get a job. The mentorship program was essential for me to do my best and stay on track, and I don't think I would have had nearly the same experience without it. Their time estimates are extremely optimistic (unless maybe you're doing the course full-time) but they do support the students who need it. If you are looking for a UX course, I would highly suggest Springboard.Read Less",springboard,11035

What made the difference on my resume is not that I had a/A listed, but that I had actual projects with links to live websites and bullets talking about the technical details of what I worked on. That's honestly the biggest strength in this (or any) coding bootcamp. Yes, I learned a ton from the instructors, the lectures, the curriculum, and even from my classmates. But what I needed to land a job was real experience working on real projects using the technologies that companies are looking for. Whether or not you have any prior coding experience, you WILL come out of this bootcamp with at least 3 projects that you can call your own and discuss in-depth with potential employees. There's nothing more exciting than reading at a job description a week after graduation and realizing, ""Wow, I know how to do all of that."" My perspective is definitely skewed by the fact that I had a CS degree coming in. However, I can assure you that by the time we got to week 3, we were learning things way beyond what I was taught in college. And yet there were plenty of students around me with no coding background at all who were doing as good or better than I was. It's a very tough course. Expect that you will have to pour every ounce of yourself into it for 4 months straight, with the constant fear of failure hanging over your head. Make sure you are mentally (and physically) ready to handle that. But if you are, then you will do fine, and you will get a job afterwards.Read Less",app-academy,10525

Understand that any bootcamp is creating a foundation of skills. It's really a taster of the field.

Pros Curriculum is excellent Numerous touchpoints throughout the bootcamp. --Student Advisor --Dedicated Mentor who guides you through the program --Office hours with a Springboard person --Great Slack network --Mentor on Demand - multiple people --Career Counseling --Several mock interviews both technical and behavioral You are then a part of a really big network full of interesting people who have all kinds of backgrounds. You get a lot of exposure, guidance, and help for troubleshooting. I took the online self-paced full time version. I happened to get a job within the first 8 weeks of the program and took a 4 month pause to onboard to that role and then complete the rest of the bootcamp for the final two months. Everyone was very supportive, patient, and really helped with managing stress, burnout, and motivation. It's really nice to be learning the material in a safe, supportive environment and know that everyone is interested and vested in your success. The curriculum is comprehensive and the resources shared are amazing. Before enrolling in Springboard's program, I tried to create my own bootcamp but it turns out that it is very difficult to find appropriate data when you yourself are outside of a business context (meaning, a lot of data is proprietary). I learned a little bit on my own but the structure and progression of the program is really worth the price tag. It really is an investment and opens your world up to a lot of great networking opportunities and practice. For Tooling, the curriculum follows Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Python. You complete case studies and projects using these tools. Remember that it's the business problem that's driving the tool usage and not the other way around. Be agnostic to tools and solutions, but it's really about the business problem you're solving for. There is also the core skills associated with data analytics and that's the financial perspective, the economic perspective, and the statistical perspective, all underpinned by strategic frameworks. Springboard is like a compressed MBA in this way and jumpstarts your business understanding if you don't already have it. Remember that the bootcamp is creating a strong foundation for you on which to build your data skills. You cannot become a subject matter expert in a matter of months, it does take years, so understanding that is really key as you make a career change.Read Less",springboard,11035

Having graduated from the Data Scientist (after approx. 9 months), I am stunned with how much I've learned in such a short amount of time, especially considering my background... Read More is not in tech. I signed up for yandex after graduating with a PhD in philosophy; my goal was to use my critical thinking skills in a tech field that would produce tangible results. I began by trying to learn data science on my own, but was quickly overwhelmed by how much there was to learn. Enter Practicum by Yandex. From the very start of this program, we were given modules in 2-week sprints. Each module consisted of a chapter of material we need to review, tasks for each section of the chapter, and a project. The chapter generally took a few days to go through, and the project about one week (with the grading procedure). When completing the projects, the code is scrutinized by practicing data scientists, and they often provide important feedback that may not have been covered in the course material. On the data science track, you start with learning how to program in python and use data analysis libraries. You then move on to conducting data analysis and statistical analysis. During this time, you practice data visualization in your projects and learn how to structure notebooks. Once the data analysis portion of the program is complete, you branch off into machine learning, which I found most interesting. Each module covers some important aspect of machine learning, and each project sees you building your own model, or oftentimes multiple models. With all that I've learned at Yandex, I've been able to participate in data science competitions and have scored in the top 10%. This is something I know I couldn't have done on my own, and for that I am extremely grateful to Yandex. I will say, I was a bit apprehensive at the start of the program because I saw that the price for the bootcamp was quite a bit lower than similar bootcamps; I guess this must be because lower operating costs, because I honestly could not find anything to complain about. They offer great lessons, robust feedback, constant support through Slack, and a genuinely nice community to be a part of. Having just completed the course this week, I was sad to think that I would be leaving the community now. Amazingly, Yandex had something else up it's sleeve - a career resource course. The course covers all the steps necessary to get a job, from writing an in-depth resume, to building a web presence, to mastering the tech interview. As I said, I am very happy that I chose to study with Practicum by Yandex. It was a fantastic experience, and I am extremely grateful for all the guidance and support I received.Read Less",practicum-bootcamp,11225

Read More be drowning in student loans -- even though tech is definitely a field in which most will do absurdly well financially. When everything is already online, you really don't miss out on much in comparison to university. College really only has one big advantage still and that's the experience of being around other students of different disciplines, belief structures, etc. With COVID, that advantage has been stripped. Math too I suppose... But you can always come back to college after gaining some experience and savings to pay for your tuition without excess stress. I'm happy to say that for me, it was an excellent decision. No one thought it was though -- my family, friends, and even some of my CS student peers thought it was a poor decision, some probably still do. That said, I started the program in late Oct. of 2020 and finished in early Oct. 2021, almost a full year, which honestly I did not expect as I have a bit more background in CS and figured that'd make it go quicker. Here's why it took me a bit longer, in April, I got hired as a software engineer! I worked part time to pay for my living expenses throughout the rest of the course and am now transitioning to a fulltime role. My advice, don't listen to others even when they may have your best interest in mind. They hardly know what they're doing with their own lives, forge your own path. If you want it and are ready/willing to put in the work, you will more than likely find success. I recommend this bootcamp heavily. I think it's an excellent choice for those who are confident that they want to be software engineers. The mentors, career advisors, and other resources are definitely excellent, but at the end of the day, all the best programmers are mostly self-taught. It's important to be sure you are ready for this though. While I do believe that anyone can be an excellent software engineer, the profession/industry is not always for everyone. Learn some basic programming first and make sure you really do enjoy the process of debugging, googling, and sitting for hours day after day, that is exactly what you're signing up for. If you're okay with that, then sign up, you won't be disappointed!Read Less",springboard,11035

You also have calls with a career coach while you are simultaneously going through the technical material. This early prompting to start thinking about how you are going to get a job and slowly building skills necessary for this were extremely helpful for me.

Before going into the intricacies of the program a brief disclaimer: Practicum by Yandex is online-based and you learn to code by reading the theory / doing exercises on a platform and a practical project after every sprint. The projects are great, covering a wide range of topics and get reviewed and approved by professional Data Analysts who tell you were you went astray and give hints to improve. In my opinion the self-learning works great if you have a job or other studies beside the boot camp but it also means that you have to structure your schedule alone. Other people might prefer classroom learning, but those courses are A) way more pricey and B) do not allow you to study when is best for you (which for me is mostly in the middle of the night). Also, while Practicum has great tutors and a Slack community where you you can post every questions you might have, in the end learning to code is a lonely trial-and-error process because you will only understand the techniques by trying it out yourself. With this out of the way, the curriculum covers what you need: Data cleaning, data visualization in Python and Tableau, statistical tools, some machine learning, the already mentioned web scraping and SQL. Personally I found the course well balanced, but I would recommend to enrich it with one or two Udemy courses or YouTube tutorials where need be - as an Economist I already knew the statistics in the course, but had not worked with data base queries before and did some extra research there. So this might vary, depending on each students' background. To sum it up: If you want a boot camp that gives you maximum freedom and responsibility for your own progress while providing top-notch material and professional feedback on your coding projects - then Practicum might be the right pick.Read Less",practicum-bootcamp,11225

This ensures that your preparedness for seeking a job, getting/doing interviews, and landing a first tech job progresses on a track that coincides with your technical skills development. The only possible con would be if you weren’t looking for a job. If that is the case then the price is a bit steep for the technical skill development alone.

Read More further than I would ever have been able to go on my own. Personally, I think the high pressure of App Academy alone is worth the price. Do some back-of-the-envelope math for yourself, but, for me, the opportunity to get a job as a software engineer 4-5 months faster than it would've taken me if I were self-teaching (just a guess; it might've taken much longer) was easily worth more money than the cost of tuition. But the bootcamp isn't just about ""structure and accountability"", which is what people usually talk about when they're explaining why they did a bootcamp. The team project was extremely helpful when I was interviewing, and the job search support is A+, too. (Again, they push you to do far more than you probably would do on your own, like applying to 40 jobs in your first week on the market. They can also connect you to ""partner"" employers, though YMMV.) Are there downsides? You bet! The time commitment is extreme. I gave up my social life for 4 months (plus a month of job-hunting). By the end, I was pretty ragged and feeling overworked. Also, the lectures in the morning were sometimes pretty awful, since many of the instructors are not great teachers and are reading from someone else's lecture notes. In their defense, most university-level teaching is awful, too, so it's not like you're going to find a better alternative. The upshot is that you need to be extremely self-motivated: Hit every target they give you, and compensate for any weaknesses in the curriculum/teaching by doing your own research. Is the lecture confusing or the assignment vague? Ask for help, scour the internet for other resources, and don't settle for being confused. One more thing: Make sure you're ready. A number of students in my cohort didn't finish the program. As part of applying to a/A you need to complete their introductory curriculum, but I would recommend doing additional work (e.g. at least a few weeks of CS50x) just to make sure you really love this stuff enough to do it even when it's exhausting/difficult. Don't quit your job until you're sure you can take whatever a/A throws at you (and more)!

I believe you also can look at the curriculum for your lifetime in case you ever need to refer back to it. They constantly update their curriculum. Portfolio - Springboard knows what companies like and the Industry Design Project (IDP) gives you hands-on experience that managers like to see. You also develop two case studies and a design sprint that showcases your skills. Mentorship - Mentorship is an invaluable resource when learning new skills. If you seek to grow you need insight from those that have been doing it longer. It gives you an edge up over other people that are gunning for the same job because you are partnered with the very managers and leads that you will be applying to. Career - There are career coaches that help to support you in your career search as you go through the curriculum and there is a lot of good nuggets I've received in how to network. It's uncomfortable to network but it's necessary. I gave Job Assistance a 4/5 just because springboard does everything except get you the internship or the job themselves.

Be prepared to spend over 90-100 hours a week learning. Since the program is so fast paced, if you fall behind it's very difficult to catch up. Some of the AA material online is out of date from what’s being currently used. For example the curriculum teaches how to use the old React Router syntax instead of the newest one. Overall it does teach you the core concepts of many different technologies in a short amount of time.

Read More Practicum’s curriculum teaches students not only how to code, but also how to work in the industry. The base curriculum covers software engineering foundations before diving deep in the most popular frameworks in use today. The curriculum is taught in “sprints”, meaning that chapters are learned in two-week sessions that begin with theory and practice on Practicum’s custom learning platform, and end with real life projects that students can include in their portfolios. Throughout each sprint, students have a chance to learn from a tutor dedicated to their cohort, as well as other students further along in the course, some dedicated specifically to their cohort as well. Practicum’s code review process provides students with feedback in a way that models industry practices as well. This feedback is invaluable in deepening understanding of topics learned throguhout each sprint. Practicum’s Apiary program, a free and optional extra curricular, gives students a chance to work on small teams to build real projects for real companies. I participated in three of these projects and cannot emphasize enough how valuable they were for me. Learning to collaborate with others, learning to adopt newtechnologiess to solve unique problems, and learning what it feels like to build *real* projects gave me a massive leg up in the interview process. After graduation, the Career Acceleration program helped me take the final steps and land a job. Early on in the course I was provided with great guidance as to how to create a rock solid online presence. A dedicated career coach met with me weekly to discuss successes, shortcomings, and goals for the upcoming week. A few mock interviews, both personal and technical, set me up to crush reali interviews when the time came. Throughout the whole course, from day one even up until now, Practicum’s growing Slack community has been wonderful. Students from all courses come together to offer guidance, advice, motivation, and celebration. I’m still in touch with many people I studied with, including tutors.

Read More compete with those who has formal specialized education, such as in computer science or data science. While a lack of formal experience through employment is still a problem, it is somewhat alleviated by the hands-on curriculum projects and the projects done after completing the course. In my feeling, completing this course gives you a credibility. There are three main components: career coaching by people experienced in technical recruiting, mentorship by data scientists working in industry, and well organized tutorial materials. In my opinion, it would be very hard for a self-learner to achieve such pace and quality of learning. Having to pay disciplines and ensures a good pace of learning. Not everyone gets a good mentor. My two advices here are: 1) change the mentor if he behaves like he is your boss and only demands, and you need to spend a lot of time just to think what questions are good and bad. This could be OK only in the beginning. 2) Stick to the one who is genuinely willing to help. Springboard allows to switch to another mentor, they have some long-term selection in place. Most career coaches are very helpful, you can meet with them roughly every week. Here my suggestion is to stay organized: write their suggestions and execute on the same day, because otherwise you will find it difficult to get back to it due to a lot of main technical learning which keeps piling up if you are not as organized. Make sure to agree with your family members: they will miss you a lot 6 to 9 months, because they will mostly see your back while you are sitting at the computer. The skills you get are worth it, but there is still a long job search ahead after graduation in most cases. Delve deeply into material, as there are four mock up interviews close to the end of the course. The best ways to prepare for Data Science course is to learn Python, Statistics, and SQL in advance, and try to craft a resume and LinkedIn profile. At the end, you learn how to extend your network, data analysis, and machine learning. Only basic familiarity with statistics and SQL, but there are many resources in the curriculum, which you can use for training, including after graduation.

Read More from the ground up and will receive unwavering support without falling behind. To begin with, the price is very reasonable when compared to other Bootcamps, and you can pay in installments. They also have the premise that if you do not get hired within six months of graduating, your investment will be returned. This tells me where their focus is. The program is quite extensive. It covers a wide range of topics, including how to manage your time and resources, developer roles and functions, and an in-depth look at your career path as a developer. Practicum has their own custom platform for reading each lesson and practicing code. It’s quite engaging and well structured. It’s divided into sections called sprints. Each sprint includes a project that puts your newly acquired knowledge to the test. They are intriguingly difficult, but you are never alone; your tutor is always available to help you when you need it. Practicum has an online student guide that contains insightful information as well as literally everything you need to know about their program. Study planning, sprint schedules, recordings of live coding webinars and career conferences, extracurriculars such as Apiary, Code Jams, Senior Student Opportunities; student perks, and more. Deadlines are given for completing each section, and the time allotted is reasonable. When your code is reviewed and passed, you will feel a sense of accomplishment. I must say that the code reviewers are first-rate, and they ensure that your code meets industry standards. I went into the course thinking I knew enough about CSS and HTML and couldn't wait to get started on the JavaScript portion of the course, but I couldn't have been more wrong. To put it another way, the methodologies taught clarified and reinforced everything I thought I knew. When it comes to the community, let's be honest: people will be busy at times. However, the practicum community managers have always responded quickly, and the web tutors are always eager to assist. It makes no difference whether they are assigned to your cohort or not. I messaged about 5 Tutors privately at one point, and they all responded within 48 hours. On the same day, one of them had a conference call with me. It is always difficult to learn new material. The most important takeaway from this bootcamp is that you can always ask for help if you get stuck. You may be in a cohort where the students are not as engaging, but the staff always ensures that the conversations continue. Every week, they have something called coworking hours on the Slack channel. Every day, a Web Tutor is assigned to conduct a live conference call to answer any questions. I mean anything, regardless of the sprint or project you're working on. There is also something called Code Jam, which happens a few times a year. You get to work with students from all over the world to build a project. You will also have the opportunity to work on real-world projects with an established tech company before graduating. It is incorporated into the curriculum, but it is entirely optional. The program is rather lengthy, but it is worthwhile once completed. Those who focus on the negatives are overreaching. Having said that, it's only been four months and I've met every deadline, I'm not burnt out, and I've never been left hanging. I'm learning and having a great time.Read Less",practicum-bootcamp,11225

The core strengths and key takeaways I gained from this course was a new approach to structured thinking, a deeper understanding of the importance of networking, and the confidence to become a constant self-learner. Before this course, I had no idea where to begin as a budding data analyst. I had no clue what skills I needed to learn or what those technical skills even did. But, after finishing this course, I now have a clear understanding of what a data analyst does, what the tools of a data analyst are, and what the tools do. Also, now I know how to approach networking with people. Through this course, I gained the confidence I needed to reach out to people for networking, for jobs, for advice, and for help/mentorship. Lastly, Springboard's Data Analytics Career Track program excels due to it's large community of support. Through others in your cohort or through Springboard's large panel of career coaches and mentors, they provide a great source of mental, emotional, and technical support you may need to help you successfully transition into a career as a data analyst.

He does a great job and was super easy to follow along with. It was pretty rare that I would complete a video and not understand the concepts he had presented. -I found the Career Services very impressive. The career coaches are really high-caliber individuals in the field of job searching, recruiting, resume building, etc. Very, very helpful. They even made themselves available to me outside of the allotted career calls. -The mentors are also a great resource. My mentor was very easy to get ahold of and a highly-skilled programmer who was able to show me lots of little details that the curriculum would not have had the time to get into. He is actively involved in the industry right now so he is able to translate ""classroom"" material into how it works in the real world. -Obviously I don't have experience with other bootcamps to compare, but I think the price of Springboard is very, very reasonable. The assignments (which may be the most important part of any program) were appropriately challenging. Most of them required going beyond what was explicitly taught in the lesson and forced you to go deeper (in a good way). ---CONS -In my humble opinion, I think the curriculum spends a little too much time on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). From what I understand, this model is beginning to be replaced by more functional programming. I also think React should be introduced much earlier. That seems to be the most prominent front-end framework right now, so it would be beneficial to learn that sooner rather than ""mastering"" traditional vanilla JavaScript. -There were times where the Springboard site was a little bit glitchy, but it was never so much of an issue that it prevented me from working for much time. Definitely not glitchy enough to be a major concern.Read Less",springboard,11035
