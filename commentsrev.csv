Read More or whatever (again nothing was made clear) they are saying that I can't cancel until after June and that Affirm it still going to charge me $600+ for a class I am not even taking. Customer support is awful, the policies aren't made clear and from what I can tell the class structure is a mess. I decided not to take the class because it didn't seem worth the money and was nothing like how it was described. There were only 3 lame projects that I could easily finish in a few weeks, sorry but not worth paying $600 for! Also it should be noted that the support person I was talking to was extremely rude and ""suggested that I focus my time on studying"" instead of complaining. EXCUSE ME? There are better ways of learning online for a lot less money and with better support. Also ask yourself this, how many people do you know getting jobs because they took one of these stupid Udacity courses? It should be noted that I was a Grow with Google Udacity scholarship recipient a few years ago so I what I now know is that this company is mostly just out to get their hooks in you by luring you in with something free only to keep you coming back and paying for more and more courses. Don't be fooled by their tech savvy website and marketing skills, this is just another for-profit school with phony certifications redesigned for the tech era.Read Less",udacity,11118

I think the teachers are also ok.The material is super outdated and very low level. They use materials from 2016-2017, some of them are not actual and... Read More many of the source materials are not available. Teachers upload missing data to google drive as they realize its missing, but we still use outdated stuff.Learning portals(Udemy, Coursera etc) vs IronhackLearning material: Learning portals: 10/10, very up to date, and huge selection.Ironhack: 3/10, outdated and the same for years without change. They don't even take effort to find out tasks, you have to do them.Price:Learning portals: 10/10 , from free, super cheapIronhack: 2/10, 7000$, can be much, much more at other bootcamp schoolsTeacher knowledge:Learning portals: 10/10, the greatest minds are sharing their knowledge.Ironhack 3/10: They definately are not stupid. And they do their best I'm assuming. But its not compareable.Hours included:Learning portals: as much as you wantIronhack: 400ish(half of them are 'standups' and 'games' which are not fun super useless and really do take a lot of time away).Actual hours put in:Learning portals: 2/10, usually people slack off because its free/cheap and there is no time limit.Ironhack: 7/10, as above, you pay and you want to get something for your money so you slack less.Paper for people with no PHD:Learning portals: 3/10, if you can actually do what is in your 'certifications', the sky is the limit. But just the certificate itself doesn't worth shit.Ironhack: 2/10, same as above, but since you can only learn less, you can't show up more.Career support:Learning portals: usually close to 0Ironhack: I did not attend this, i was disappointed enough in the 10 weeks. I don't expect anything big, the only 'alumni' they could get to talk to us as previous student was a super lowlvl job(the guy was cool though so no offense there).This could be said about all courses and bootcamps on the world, but from online courses you can get refunds super easily if you dont like something, so its easier to select out the trash. With bootcamps you pay thousands of dollars with no hope of a refund if its shit.TLDR: Overall experience:I'm not sure what I expected from this, I was new to the field and wanted to jump in somehow, just learning a few hours every now and then was not really effective. So in a way it was good, because I spent the time on learning, not on playing games etc. Also i did not have to work during the 10 week with full salary because of covid. So i only regret it halfsy.Don't do any bootcamps if you can sit down by yourself to study/read stuff. The only reason to pick a bootcamp is because you can't get yourself to sit down and learn. If you can, online learning is the way.Oh i almost forgot: Teachers, TAs and job supporters were many times late and cancelling appointments(during full lockdown, they were working from home but cancelled the hours!!)Read Less",ironhack,10828
3,281385,0,,2021,0,,Data Analytics Bootcamp,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Dear Leadies and Gentelmen, I will share with you my terrible experience with Ironhack hoping that it will be useful to you and that you will not make the mistake I made. I also read a lot of reviews and saw very few negative ones, even ignoring them... Read More thinking that these were just exceptions, people who did not want to learn something new. But now I know they were people telling the truth. I don't want to offend anyone, I just see Ironhack as a service provider and I evaluate it as I see it. So let's begin! 1. The Teacher – Ignacio Soretas He can't speak English properly! He has a hard time understanding what we said, of course, I understand that English is not his mother language, but this is not just about pronunciation, it’s about the word combination he uses. He just lacks the ability to explain, to express himself correctly. Also, if you ask him a question, either verbal or written, he cannot understand what you are asking him, he cannot answer the question. It happened very often we asked him the same question in 1283091238901 different ways, just to understand what we are asking him and he again either says that he does not understand the questions or starts talking nonsense. Things that have nothing to do with the question. Example: Question: Hey Ignacio, how to clean this data? Answer: It’s very important to clean your data. OR I don't understand what you're asking ################################################################################################# It flows from topic to topic. Very often while talking about one topic he turns to another or goes back explaining some things he forgot to say, but we talked about them 2 hours ago and now he remembered to say them. Let me give you a similar example that will help us understand what I mean. Let's imagine that we have a task to cook a pizza. I guess most of the people reading this post know how to cook pizza and that's why I chose this example. Here's how Ignacio Soretas would explain how to cook a pizza. Example: Once you bought the dough from the store now roll it out and start making a pizza, then Michael Jackson was a very famous singer of the time, I forgot to tell you that he had no children, take the pizza out of the oven and eat. This was an example that contained words and objects that are close to our daily lives. It was easy to detect the catch, but now imagine he is talking about stuff you hear for the first time like data analysis, statistics etc... It’s impossible to understand what he means, but he left you with confusion with many questions. ################################################################################################# 2. Curriculum The simplest and most basic things we all need to know we’re not explained. Things like how to create a table (Data Frame) in Pandas (Python library used to operate with data). How to fill this table with information. How to change the values in the table and other basic stuff. The biggest downside is that they didn't teach us to THINK like a data analyst, they didn't teach us how to ask questions and how to check them, through the data, how to clean data, and many many more. ################################################################################################# Also, the exercises we had to do were not well structured and are not suitable for beginners. Task descriptions are very bad, it is difficult to understand what they want from us even for a person who is a native English speaker. Very often the exercises included tasks that were not adequate for everyday life. Things that have nothing to do with us. Difficult to assimilate and thus further complicate the understanding of the task. For example, things like some Pokemons and similar cartoon characters. We had the task to process a table with the characteristics of Pokemon and draw conclusions about them. Like ‘Who is the strongest Pokemon?’. As you can guess for people who have never seen this cartoon and have no idea about Pokemon, the difficulty of the task increases. Once because you do not understand what information the table contains and second because you do not understand how the code work, with which you are trying to process the table. It would be much better if the exercises contained things that are much closer to the problems in real life, things that we encounter every day, such as tables with information about food and so on. ################################################################################################# The lectures were nothing more than reading aloud, and there was nothing of added value. Not to mention that there were days when the lectures lasted about 4-5 hours from 9 to 14:00 in the afternoon and after such a long listening nothing remains in your head. The information should be conveyed in small steps and at small intervals, not a lot of information together. ################################################################################################# Often they said to us that if we had questions we should ask Google or our teammates and if we failed then we would ask for help from the assistant or the teacher. Well, this brings us automatically to the question if I have to ask my classmates or Google then why did I pay you more than 7K euros? ################################################################################################# SQL is the number 1 required skill to find a job as a data analyst, well we learn it only for one week… but spend 3 weeks in ML doing something that nobody understands, and nobody will hire us to make a model that we don’t understand how they work. Tableau is the number 2 required skill to find a job as a data analyst but we learn it only one day! ONLY ONE DAY, yes you read right ONLY ONE DAY! ################################################################################################# 3. Job support is even worst. I will tell you only that few months later I can’t find a job in the analytics field, and I will end there, hopefully, I helped you to understand what are the hidden costs of taking a Bootcamp at Ironhack. ################################################################################################# Of course, there are many more bullshits around them but yea, that’s enough for now. As a summary! STAY AWAY from IRONHACK! STAY AWAY from IRONHACK! Go to Udemy, Coursera, etc… and remember Data Analytics isn’t a sprint it’s a lifelong journey!Read Less",ironhack,10828

I've been contacted with someone named Ariana Quintana to have a meeting and assist me in my application. The application began smothly... Read More but slowly turned down hell when I started asking about the course and curriculum. She was very rude and said why are you asking about Tabloue? didn't you read our Syllabus? if you are interested stuyding Tablou you shouldn't have contacted us because we don't teach it. I told her but is in the Syllabus ! and questioning my intelgiance by not reading the Syllabus. eventually she saw Tablou written in the Syllabus and said I don't know why it's there but we don't teach it. At the end I had enough with this employee and her attitude and told her I am no longer interested in attending your school ! she said well we don't want people like you too. Then asked her please to no longer send me the assisment test and hanged the meeting. I urge people in charge of Ironhack to rreevaluate this employee and give her some classes on how to talk to people and if the meeting was recored please check the way she talk to see it yourself.

The 9 weeks are just to get started with the basics. There are bootcamps that teach for over 20-30 weeks with the same price but the knowledge gained it far better.

The career hack was full of so many promises but lacked a lot. The career coaches have no clue on how a tech interview takes place nor have they ever applied to any tech job. My 2 cents from the entire experience would be save your money and do some Udemy courses. They are same. Ironhack boasts about it's network, but you're free to go for their meetup and events, or better go for in general tech events in your city. They are far more productive and rewarding.Read Less",ironhack,10828
